0,5,2006 Mustang GT Doesn’t disappoint,2006,Marca_A,2018-06-06,2018,6,6,Wednesday
1,3,"DREAM CAR I bought mine 4/17 with 98K. Have been wanting a V6 5-sp, '05-'09 vintage for years. The engine is fine. Sounds good. Great mileage. Good power. I pride myself on smooth take-off and gear changes, but this is the orneriest transmission I've ever used! The difference between idle and 4000 rpm is about 1/8"" on the gas pedal, so starting-out without either stalling or way over-revving takes a LOT of finesse. Gear changes are very difficult to master smoothly without lurching. The ride is very harsh with a lot of road noise, which I suppose goes with a quasi high-performance car. My '01 S-10 is quieter and smoother. All that said, it's a smokin' hot looking car, and still fun to drive. This was the first-off of the modern 'Stangs. Hopefully these problems have been ironed-out since.",2006,Marca_A,2017-08-12,2017,8,12,Saturday
2,5,Great Ride There will always be a 05-09 mustang for sale and their fairly reasonable. Purchased mine as second car and I believe it was a great investment,2006,Marca_A,2017-06-15,2017,6,15,Thursday
3,5,"I have wanted a Mustang for 40 years. I bought my car from an auction I work at ( Adesa Sacramento ) and I love it!! It is a v6 with an air aid cold air injector, throttle body spacer and a Flowmaster exhaust. The previous owner also added blacked out 17 inch factory rims. This beast will smoke any G6 or v6 camaro out there.... If you can buy a base model and do the bolt on stuff yourself do it!!!!",2006,Marca_A,2017-05-18,2017,5,18,Thursday
4,5,One owner I bought this car spankin new and i still am In love with this car.  This car hugs the road and does whatever you ask at a moments notice.   The only thing I have had to fix is the alternator.   Of course there are repairs like tires and brakes. This car has gone all these years and no mechanical breakdown!   How many cars can you say that about?This car is GREAT!,2006,Marca_A,2016-01-03,2016,1,3,Sunday
5,3,"Poor Lots of problems with Ford these days, sensors issues, cam phasers, and got solenoid problems.",2006,Marca_A,2015-10-24,2015,10,24,Saturday
6,4,06 mustang gt with a few mods Bought mine used 20k on it and have added a SCT tuner with Ford CAI and Flow master mufflers.I get 19.5 mpg in town and 24.5 mpg highway onregular 87 octane gas with normal driving. No major mechanical issues to report and have taken several long road trips in it with good comfort. The mustang GT offers great bang for the buck performance and decent fuel economy. The car is easy to work on for all the do it your self guys and gals. Would I buy a mustang again you betcha... ,2006,Marca_A,2011-10-29,2011,10,29,Saturday
7,4,"2006 Ford Mustang GT Premium 2dr Coupe (4.6L 8cyl 5M) I bought my preowned 06 a few weeks back and am very glad I did. Screaming Yellow, car had some upgrades from previous owner (Airaid air filter system, Flowmaster exaust) It's about 360 horses of extreme fun. Although the car had 51K on it, Honda dealer included 3 year 36K bumper to bumper waurranty, and I plan to get the best out of those 36,000 miles. At 45 it was a mid-life crisis the wife even agreed with. LOL",2006,Marca_A,2011-07-25,2011,7,25,Monday
8,3,"Get Rid of it before 100K I drive 50 miles each way to work and traded my 01 accord for a 06 mustand in 2008. Well 80k miles later the engine starts having this knocking noise and significant loss of power and not because I don't take care of my car as I changed my oil every 3K miles and keep it very well maintained. After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver. Long story short before you buy research cam phasers this appears to be an issue in many Ford",2006,Marca_A,2011-07-21,2011,7,21,Thursday
9,4,"Get this car. This car is just awesome.  The 4.6L V8 makes the car, and the stock exhaust has a nice rumble to it that screams when you mash the pedal to the floor.  I've had the car for 2 years and have about 52,000 miles on her with zero problems.  For the price, you really can't beat it either (16300 in 2009 with 33k miles). Its faster, better looking, and really just more of a car than any used BMW/mercedes within its pricing segment.  The only comparable competitor in the used car market this years Mustang has is in the 350z, which handles better but lacks in practicality.  And on top of that, the Z doesn't sound as good as the 8 and after test driving could be a nightmare as a daily driver",2006,Marca_A,2010-12-06,2010,12,6,Monday
10,4,Fun stang Only had car for one week and this car put the fun back into driving.Even though it's a V6 it still get up and goes.I love the way it handles and turns heads.,2006,Marca_A,2010-10-29,2010,10,29,Friday
11,4,"Well worth the wait! Previous mustang owner (1980) and have had a serious stalking issue with this car since Ford introduced the '05 model.  I don't care too much for the look of the 09-11 models, and recently found an '06 and bought it from the original owner.  He drove it a lot (70k miles), but took good care of it and she looks sweet.  So much fun to drive and decent gas mileage too.       ",2006,Marca_A,2010-08-22,2010,8,22,Sunday
12,4,"166K miles and still going strong I drive a lot of miles, at least 150/day.  I just had the water pump replaced at 166,000 miles and decided it was time to do the rest of the maintenance that I have neglected for the last 5 years.  I changed the oil regularly with Mobil 1 and changed the brakes when necessary.  Other than that everything has always worked perfectly.  I replaced the spark plugs at 140,000 miles just because.  The originals still looked good, just needed a gap adjustment.",2006,Marca_A,2010-08-20,2010,8,20,Friday
13,4,"Max Lives I purchased this Horsey in memory of my dad, Max M. Kruger a design engineer and an original member of the Mustang design team under Lee Iaccoca at Ford.  Compared to my 2 previous '73 Mach I joys, this Steed is more stealthy, has greater visibility and obviously more technologically refined. Had only one real issue with her.  The trip meter occasionally zero's itself even after extensive dealer repairs and tech help from Ford. Yes a few rattles. Also needed a new battery due to Florida heat. Got a set of General Ulimax HP tires and they are the best I ever owned. I'm not sure which I like better, watching my wife drive off in her, me driving us, or just looking at her.  Max Lives!",2006,Marca_A,2010-07-22,2010,7,22,Thursday
14,4,"Great car, couple of issues Dash board rattles, dealer couldn't fix it, filed lemon law got $2000 from Ford. Brake pads & rotors went at 12,000 miles witch is unheard of, $600- $800 job. Replaced bat after 3 yrs which is norm. Replaced fuel filter which is recommended. Rear brake bulbs have been replaced about 4 times (easy to do yourself though) other then that nothing major has gone wrong. I drive 12,000 a year, some highway road trips and still drives great.",2006,Marca_A,2010-06-19,2010,6,19,Saturday
15,4,"Only a few minior issues I drive very little (about 5k miles per year), but when I do i like to wring it out around town, on the highway, and twisty back-country roads.  This car handles them all very well.  Haven't had any real issues, and have kept up with scheduled maintenance.  I did have a transmission pan leak which was repaired by a dealer; a few months later it was leaking again and the dealer fixed it again (free as was still under warr. then).  I have an extended warranty for peace of mind but don't anticipate needing it.  There has always been a little squeak near the gauge cluster, which I meant to get fixed but it hasn't bothered me enough to do so.",2006,Marca_A,2010-06-11,2010,6,11,Friday
16,3,"It is what it is This was my first new car purchase and I really liked it at first....Untill everyone in Oklahoma city bought one. Atleast there will be pleanty around to pull parts of in the salvage yard. Guys and gals, this car is what it is plus a tiny, tiny bit more..... It's a (new) $20,000 sports car. I do actually love mine and it runs great but I can see it going to pieces not too far down the road. It's starting to rattle a little much and the two ""subs"" in the door aren't subs.... Subs are made to play mounted in a box, not mounted in a door but hats off to ford for at least trying to be hip. ",2006,Marca_A,2010-04-28,2010,4,28,Wednesday
17,4,Lemon Mustang Nice styling car and fun to drive when it is not heading back to dealership for unending mystery electrical problems.  I have had to many problems with this car to ever want another sports car again.  Couple that with a dealership that wants to nickel and dime you on warranty work makes for bad Ford business.  Not a practical car to own in the winter time in Colorado Springs.    ,2006,Marca_A,2010-04-19,2010,4,19,Monday
18,4,"So so.... I was exceptionally impressed with the down and dirty V6.  The Chevy Monte Carlo LT and SS Intimidator have nothing on the 4.0 stock!! I bought an 06 5-speed Pony Edition before I went to college.  It's about 8 months later and the throttle body is havin issues, killing the car about every 30 miles.  The clutch is slipping already, not impressed with that.  The Shaker 500 is really nice, don't crank it too loud though.  The amp for the stereo runs down the factory battery like no other.  It's reliable as heck until the engine starts acting up.  Had the system checked, so I know its the throttle body.  For a car that is four years old, the clutch and induction should not be having trouble.",2006,Marca_A,2010-03-01,2010,3,1,Monday
19,4,"Great looking car I purchased the Mustang new with every option you could get on the V6 Premium Cpe including ""Pony Package"".  It's the first American car I've bought in 20 years.  Great looking car with a very stiff ride and lots of rattles.  At 30k service, it needed an Alternator and a battery. All things considered, I like the car sans the rattles which the dealer has been unable to fix.  I have a 20 year old toyota with out any rattles!",2006,Marca_A,2010-02-24,2010,2,24,Wednesday
20,3,"Worst Mustang ever, Don't buy Ford !!! 09/23/06 I financed a '06 Mustang GT, my 1st new car. Previously my family and I have had about 10 Fords. after 6 mos. the car stalled out, I didnt think anything of it. In'07 the problem became more noticeable I also had the battery replace twice. The alternator and L/F headlight (water). In'08 the problem became more frequent stalling between 30-40mph. The dealer couldnt find thr problem after frequent visits. In Feb.'09 I was going to trade it in for a used '08 Shelby GT500. The deal fell apart when the belt kept tearing. Took it to another dealer and was told crank was bad, waited 2 mos. to have engine rebuilt. called cust.service they're very nasty. Lemon law,govt agencies,legal no help",2006,Marca_A,2010-01-18,2010,1,18,Monday
21,4,"My 1st Stang ! This car is a blast. I purchased my 06' Performance White GT Premium about 4 months ago. It drives like a dream, its everything I ever imagined. I wanted one since the day it came out and I'm not sorry for the purchase. I get a lot of compliments. So far I have not had any problems what so ever. I have taken it to the Ford dealership I purchased it from for oil changes and everytime so far everything has been 100%",2006,Marca_A,2009-11-28,2009,11,28,Saturday
22,4,great car bad battery and window system I love to drive the car and to look at the car.  I have had problems with the battery draining.  I've jumped it 5 times.  I've also had problems with the driver side window.  I had to take it to the dealership 2 times for the same issue.  The 3rd time it was out of warranty and the dealership didn't want to take ownership of the problem.,2006,Marca_A,2009-11-12,2009,11,12,Thursday
23,4,Great Car It's noisy. It rides rough.  It's uncomfortable on long trips.  It's great on gas. It looks great.  It has not let me down.  I wouldn't trade it for another.....Unless it was a newer one.  This is my second one. It's all mine.  And it's payed off!,2006,Marca_A,2009-09-23,2009,9,23,Wednesday
24,4,"Dreams are well worth working for! I've always wanted a V8 Mustang since my dad showed me a certain Steve McQueen movie called Bullitt, I just loved the styling and ferocity of McQueen's highland green '68 fastback GT. Nothing else was cooler.  Then Ford released the '05 model, now that's a Mustang! Well in a nutshell I found a tungsten grey '06 GT auto with 7k on it and bought it. Best decision ever. I love this V8! It's fast and it sounds great, though mine now sports a cold air intake and Pypes Violator exhaust and it turns heads with it's loud rumble.  Also this car is built extremely well. 31k on it and not even a rattle, not a problem. This is one I WILL NOT BE TRADING IN!",2006,Marca_A,2009-08-16,2009,8,16,Sunday
25,4,First Ford I have been very pleased for the most part with my 06 Mustang GT.  I think the retro styling of the car is great.  It's like driving a 60s Mustang only better.   The steering response is great and it corners like a dream.  I am 6'2 and have never had a car that felt this comfortable. The Shaker 500 sounds awesome.  I have had aftermarket setups that didn't sound as good.  I only have a couple complaints. The rubber strips used to seal the inside of the windows scratch the hell out of my window tint when running them up and down.  There is a rattling noise under hard acceleration that almost sounds like detonation; but I am running 92 octane fuel and have ruled that out.   Very impressed,2006,Marca_A,2009-08-15,2009,8,15,Saturday
26,4,"2006 gt premium Bought new, my red dream stang has performed, well, overall. Interior, passenger side vent rattles, interior tail light housing held in place by flimsy, plastic screw assemblies. Closing the trunk causes the rear lights to blink. On positive side, average over 20.5 miles per gallon, everywhere!. Car used mainly to go to gym and back and to the beach on weekends. Runs fast, but interior is noisy. Hope Ford adds interior insulation package to 2010",2006,Marca_A,2009-08-07,2009,8,7,Friday
27,4,"My show car Love ""Mr. Steed"".  He is a ""Bickford Built"" one-off commemorative of a 1960 GT350 with $10,000 in upgrades.   I have entered him in 6 Mustang Club of America National shows and he has won first place every time.",2006,Marca_A,2009-07-26,2009,7,26,Sunday
28,4,"What a car This is one of the nicest and fun cars I have owned, and I have had plenty of sports cars. I get alot of compliments, and the sound and power is unbelievable. This car is pretty comfortable on long trips, part of the reason is for the redesigned seats compaired to the '01 mustang GT I owned.",2006,Marca_A,2009-07-25,2009,7,25,Saturday
29,4,"Like this car a lot I currently have 31,000 miles on this car and it has never been back to the dealer. I have been doing oil changes and routine maintenance. The only complaint I have is the Road noise seems a little loud to me. I get 25 MPG driving to work - mixed city/rural, and got 28 on a long trip on the freeway. ",2006,Marca_A,2009-07-11,2009,7,11,Saturday
30,3,Quality's not there I love this car.  That's why it pains me to have to report this car's been in the shop almost a dozen times.  It was in for the rear clutch pack TSB 4 times!  The Shaker system ate several CD's.  It rattles.  It's hard to fuel at times. The A/C barely cools the interior.     I've had 10 year old Honda's that didn't exhibit 1/10th the problems this car's had.  This is the last Ford this former employee will ever buy. What a shame. ,2006,Marca_A,2009-06-22,2009,6,22,Monday
31,3,"I got one of those lemons I bought this car to be an occasional driver - I have only put 13,000 miles on it in 3 years. Here is a list of things replaced on warranty and mileage when replaced:  Differential - 500 miles Radiator fan - 1800 miles Door jamb switch - 1900 miles A/C compressor - 2900 miles Fuel pump - 6100 miles A/C high pressure switch - 7800 miles Alternator - 9200 miles A/C line - 10400 miles A/C recharged - 12700 miles  The warranty has just expired and guess what? A/C not working again. For some unknown reason this vehicle does not want to have working A/C. Very frustrating. After my experience with this car I understand why the big 3 are in financial dire straits. Very shoddy workmanship IMO.",2006,Marca_A,2009-06-20,2009,6,20,Saturday
32,4,"Best new car I've owned (I've owned 8) First the bad.  Struggling to get a full tank is unacceptable.  Turning the nozzle upside down usually fixs the problem.  Car is kinda thirsty but for the performance you get on regular gas, it's within the bounds of acceptable. I have an automatic and the hesitation on downshifting is unacceptable and unsafe when driving aggressively. Now the good. In over 39000 miles, it's never left me stranded.  Never been in the shop for repairs. Cabin is squeak and rattle free still.  Took it on a 8000mi trip and NEVER got out of it with a back ache.  Stereo is great. Seat, console and door armrest position is the best I've ever had.  I love the car and I'm not an easy person to please.  Worth a look!",2006,Marca_A,2009-06-11,2009,6,11,Thursday
33,3,"Close but no cigar Car is fun enough to drive, but having had the battery die twice in my garage, first time after owning it for two weeks, and again in June 09.  Auto feature on windows most times work fine, but often only work one way and not always the same way.  Air conditioning is poor most of the time.  Didn't work at all once, took it to the dealership- told it takes time to cool off - I guess an hour is not long enough when it's blowing hot air.  Next day it worked fine.  Wouldn't take it on a trip in hot weather.  Would not buy one again. Dealership charged me for an auto emission test, but not necessary if driven under 5000 miles in a year.",2006,Marca_A,2009-05-31,2009,5,31,Sunday
34,4,"2006 V6 Coupe Premium + Options I have owned 3 mustangs recently; a 2002 V6, a 2004 anniversary V6, and my current 2006 V6 coupe.  The 2006 is by far the best of the three I've owned. The sleek exterior reminiscent of the fastback look and retro interior are much preferred to the builds in the first half of the 2000's. My model is a torch red 5 speed manual which shifts much smoother than the previous vehicles. Options include all the V6 premium additions plus Pony Package (fog lamps / upgraded grill are sporty). The interior has a limited dark charcoal all leather finish, and the dash is upgraded to include the multi-function display below the speedometer and SHAKER-1000 Audio - much improved over previous MACH systems",2006,Marca_A,2009-05-25,2009,5,25,Monday
35,4,"She's exactly what I wanted My 2006 Mustang GT is my seventh Mustang and by far, the best. The car runs 13's in the quarter, gets over 20mpg, sounds great, and is a blast to drive. Not the best handling car on the road, not the fastest either, but a solid platform that you can make into whatever kind of Mustang you would like. Tons of after market support including: wheels and tires, body kits, suspension system upgrades, power upgrades like blowers, turbos, nitrous oxide injection, super chargers cams, heads, etc...  You take care of your Mustang and she'll take care of you. I run premium fuel and full synthetic oil. Follow the maintenance guidelines, don't be cheap and skip over expensive services.

36,4,"Have your cake and eat it too! We ordered our's Labor Day of '05 and picked it up in Nov. Power, handling, MPG, looks are all amazing. At first, the MPG was awful but it's only temporary. After the break in period, I've seen as high as 26 MPG (at avg. 77 MPH) and regularly get 23-24 MPG on my commute (1/3 city 2/3rds Hwy). I suspect, it could go as high as 30 MPG on a long trip and a moderate 65mph but don't think I never put my foot in it. Plenty have tried but no one has beat me in stop light drags. Handling is surprising for solid rear axle, but would prefer a proper independent rear suspension. There are downsides, heavy doors, squeaks & rattles from dash but this is one of the most pleasurable cars on the road!",2006,Marca_A,2009-03-14,2009,3,14,Saturday
37,3,"used to love it... I wanted the gt for many years, so I finally traded in my Mitsubishi for a 06 tungsten grey mustang gt. Ran great for about 2 months, then the problems started to occur... Ford services departments no matter where you go are no help, your better off saving time and money by going to an aftermarket shop to have any work done. I have owned it for a year and am done putting time and money into it.

38,4,"Good Buy I'll be sad to see mine go. I've had BMW's, Camaro's, and Vettes, and this is by far my favorite car to date. Very reliable so far with only one problem (fuel gauge sensor) but otherwise a perfect all around car.  Not too fast (yes there is such a thing), but more than fast enough to get you in trouble on any road.  ",2006,Marca_A,2009-02-16,2009,2,16,Monday
39,3,"Sad but True....not worth it I have owned my car for 3 years. Wanted one since I was a kid. Very unhappy. Squeaks and rattles in the dash, window tint scratches when rolled down, spoiler comes lose constantly, vibration in front end that no one can seem to fix, new rattle in suspension, beginning to have trouble with the drive train, carpet and leather wear terribly, windows are beginning to leak when washed, more wind noise etc. This car was garage kept and babied, there is no excuse for this horrible quality. Though it was fun to drive and gets lots of look I will likely never buy Ford again!

After two years of ownership a dead battery left me stranded out at work at midnight, in March I'll have had the car 3 years and I just had to put a new transmission in it at 68,000 miles. The Ford dealer said that since I hadn't had the transmission serviced at 30,000 mile intervals like the manual says I need to, they can't help. I've not had the oil changed exactly every 3,000 miles, does this mean the engine is going to blow?  Very poor quality.",2006,Marca_A,2009-01-14,2009,1,14,Wednesday
42,4,Drive It Like I Stole It I got back into the Mustang as a retiree and do not regret it. It is a fun car to drive and fulfills all my needs as a daily driver. Ya gotta love the V8 using regular-gas. It is also easily personalized and that is what I am in the process of doing.,2006,Marca_A,2008-12-20,2008,12,20,Saturday
43,4,"Elvira As soon as I got a glimpse of the 2006 Mustang GT I knew that I would have one, all I had to do was find one that was black on black. Well, that proved to be harder than anticipated. It took more than a year but we found a dealership that would allow us to build the car of our dreams. I picked Elvira up on Oct 2nd 2005 and she has been loved every day since. We drove her from Ohio to Florida in pouring rain without any trouble and surprising gas mileage. She is garage kept and stored as soon as snow threatens to fall. Our only complaint has been the cupholder position and trouble finding quality after market parts such as the shaker system that my husband suprised me with this past birthday",2006,Marca_A,2008-12-11,2008,12,11,Thursday
44,4,Incredible drive I bought my Mustang new and right away I installed slp loudmouths and a K&N aircharger. I love this car. It's never a dull moment driving it.

45,4,"The Best Mustang Yet I have owned many Mustangs. From a 1965 Coupe to a 2003 Mach 1 (I still own that one). This is the best Mustang yet in every area. It handles well, looks great, and has much more room that any previous Mustang. I have a five speed manual and it gets over 30 mpg on the highway although it is not rated that high. This car is the best ""all around"" car I have ever owned. In addition everywhere I go everyone compliments me on the car and wants to know all about it.  I have found that not only is this car welcome at Mustang shows it is also welcome at all local cruise in's, car shows, etc. Try that with your SUV.  It is 1965 all over again with this latest generation Mustang! ",2006,Marca_A,2008-09-22,2008,9,22,Monday
46,4,"Great Mustang! I've had my 06 Mustang GT for two and a half years. Overall, I love this car! The modern-retro look, the powerful v-8, the American-muscle rumble, its got it all. I always love driving it, even in my routine communites. In the world full of soccer mom mini-vans, clunky pick-up trucks, and ho-hum sedans, it feels good driving a car that stands out and demands attention. This just doesn't become a ""daily driver car"" like your grand am, accord, or malibu. This car becomes a part of you. You'll eventually end up giving this car a name like Shelby, Sally, or Eleanor.

I got the looks coupled with power handling and a quality in the build that the 68 and 69 were lacking.

The handle/knob broke off of the driver seat release to lift it forward in order to get to the back seat. The rear differential has the TSB whining noise during low speed turns. And I also had a problem a few times with the TSB of water leaking into the passenger floorboard and causing some electrical problems.

Little kids come up to me. College dudes and teens in small Japanese sporty cars often want to race. Trunk space sufficent.

71,4,"Wild Stang I purchased my 2006 GT convertible used from a dealer. It was 11 years old with only 22,800 miles on it. I had to see it to believe it. It was so beautiful.   Black  with red leather interior. I purchased the vehicle on site after a test drive of course. This is my 4th mustang and my third convertible. I am addicted to the mustangs. This model does remind me of my 1969 Grande  coupe I had. The lumbar support is a definite improvement for the lower back on this 2006 GT premium. This was a problem in my previous mustangs for longer trips over an hour or so. The pick up in acceleration is fantastic. I agree Ford should cut back on the plastics in the interior because it cheapens the vehicle.  I have a shaker 1000 system and it sounds really good. The cd player is garbage. The first cd I placed in it got stuck. I get plenty of looks and compliments all the time on her. This is a good cruiser car and the family and I enjoy the ride tremendously. Top down rolling down the highway is so soothing and therapeutic. I had a 2002 convertible and 2004 convertible and using the convertible top is a breeze on these newer models than the previous models. The top seems to completely fall into place without effort and you just lock it down with the lighter handles. I would have been great to have power passenger seat. I believe the passenger seat is too low and should have a power package or at least a manual lever to raise the seat or lower the seat and give lumbar support. The rear seats seem comfortable enough.  For a convertible, it is roomier than the Mercedes, jaguar and camaro.  The camaro does not compare. If you really look around, you can see more variations of mustangs by mustang owners than camaros. If you have a mustang, you can almost totally redesign the mustang to your personal needs with all the parts and accessories the  market have available for mustangs.  These have been very reliable. The previous fox body styles, 1999 - 2004 did have this seal leak between the transmission and engine that was annoying after about 90,000 miles and it was not a cheap fix. I am praying these new mach 1 body styles do not such flaws.  I have noticed though, the a/c in my older models got colder quicker was much colder. I saw a comment to the opposite so I am not sure why this is. I have had an 02 and 04 and you could freeze to death in there with the a/c on max. I did notice after running on the highway for a while, the car would stall if I got off the exit, stopped and then tried to take off again. I am not sure why this model does that.

Wow, for the money this car has no peer. Right out of the box the power and handling of this car are fantastic. To think I can get add-on accessories to boost this performance to even higher levels without breaking the bank is even better. Top down driving is fun.

Also had lots of comments on the ""nice ride"", one fellow with a PT cruiser convertable even made an offer to buy it at a stop light!

Handles exceptionally well, and goes almost as quick as my supercharged 01 Jag XKR.  Rougher, more raw power, but it adds to fun.  Amazingly solid for a conv.

146,5,"Kick butt old school I avoided admitting my appreciation for late-model GTs for a long time just because it was so un-P.C.  But when the '99s came out I was intrigued.  I bought my black 2000 5-speed as a lightly-used and nicely-equipped example (leather, Mach 460 stereo, etc.) in mid-2001.  Words cannot express how much I loved that car.  I drove it for 12 years and nearly 180,000 virtually trouble-free miles before trading it in on my current 2013 GT 5.0.  The good:  great performance, chunky masculine style that turns heads, cheap to maintain, very reliable, just the right touch of attitude, the sound of a 2-valve V-8 roaring through an H-pipe, reasonable economy for the performance, a good level of practicality for what it is.  My kids fit in the back.  Limitless aftermarket modifications and go-fast parts supply.  My dealer is great.  You're the coolest dad at your kids' school.  Keeps everyone at church guessing.The bad:  not much.  There are cars with better quality interior trim, more refinement, and nicer fit and finish.  But anyone buying a Mustang knows it's no Lexus.The ugly:  the backwards-hat crowd in bespoilered front-drive compacts with fart cans always wants to show off in front of you.  Your neighbors may hate it, especially if you install Flowmasters and do a full-bore romp on the gas pedal at 6 a.m.  Or at least they'll think you're a hoon.  Self-righteous European car owners may think you're tacky (full disclosure...my wife has a newer BMW X3, we're just not full of ourselves over it).  Cop bait.  Bottom line:  If you want a fast car that is reasonably practical and has just the right dose of good-natured obnoxiousness built in, you've come to the right place.  For any pre-2005 Mustang I recommend welding in a good set of subframe connectors to stiffen up the body structure for the long haul, and then driving the heck out of it.",2000,Marca_A,2016-01-14,2016,1,14,Thursday

My first beautiful 2000 Mustang V6 coupe, purchased in 2010, saved me when some tattooed meth freak hit my driver's door at 60mph as I was making a left turn on a small two lane (no passing zone). I was dazed but the car was totaled, as was f-wit's Honda. He walked away, donchaknow. The replacement, another base 2000 coupe, is even nicer, with fewer miles and the same excellent reliability.

In the rain, it is just plain dangerous.  Hydroplanes, and cannot get traction.  The car feels unsafe.  At high speeds, it was bumpy, and felt loosely connected to the road.

This car is way better than a Focus or Escort for looks and style, way safer, has decent power (for a V6), and still gets 27 mpg. Sure it doesn't have the power of the awesome V8, but I wasn't looking for a racer,  I was looking for decent MPG and good looks; this car has both.  And it still has the great Mustang name.

The throaty engine will throw your organs into the back seat if you floor it. Handles like a dream. Gas mileage is very acceptable; so far it's been better than my 2.0L Celica.

Its powerful and turns heads. Mine has the leather and suede interior which is a nice feature as all leather can get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter.

Issues were the exhaust manifold design is bad. I think the A/C drips onto it and as a result had to have it welded back together twice because it sounded like a hole in the muffler. Also the clutch went out on her 2 years ago and that had to be replaced. Other than those 2 things I have not had one single mechanical issue. She is picky about her tires. Anything but Yokahoma's seem to run rough. Extremely reliable. Cosmetics after 10 years: my top leaks in behind the back seat due to being left in the sun and not in a garage.

I love the look and drive of the car as well, and recommend the manual transmission, and the V6 if you are doing your own maintenance (more room in the engine compartment makes it easier to access).   Road noise and comfort of the convertible make it much less enjoyable on long road trips.  After an hour or two on the highway with the top down, your ears will be ringing for hours afterwards.

They never offered me a rental car until I spoke to the service manager and he checked to see what extended coverage protection I had. Fortunately I had the Extended service protection plan and so I qualified for a free rental car. No one would volunteer that information. Only after I pressed did they finally admit that I was due a rental car. They called Enterprise for me. So I am expecting my car to be in the shop for at least a week.

The ride is liveable if your expecting it, so if you are looking for a Touring ride, the performance package is not for you. The 6speed manual is a little disappointing. It clunks when shifting into gears from a stop, and is very notchy thru the upshifts. Ford says this is a normal action with the manuals, so beware when selecting a manual transmission. As expected the fuel economy is averageing 12mpg, with the 5.0 so don't complain about the lousy mileage. The GT handles very well with the GT package and steering response and brake response is excellent.

339,5,"MY AMAZING LITTLE PONY - GO PONY GO! I am in love with my new little ruby red pony car that drives like a stallion!  This is the fourth Mustang I have owned.  I purchased all of them brand new. I loved each and every one of them, and then the 2017 arrived!  I saw it featured on the internet, and I kept saying that is my new car, and it is now.  The ruby red is a metallic color, and it really shines in the sun; it is gorgeous!  I own the 6 cylinder automatic. I am extremely impressed. I almost went for the GT, but the V6 was more affordable.  I was shocked when I drove it.  It is about five times faster than the other Mustangs I have owned - the last one being a 2004.  The 2004 and the two models I purchased in the 90's all seemed sluggish.  Not my new V6; that little pony flies down the road.  I haven't driven a car that flew in a very long time.  You step on the gas, and you're off and running.  This car's acceleration is fantastic; it really moves.  When I'm at a red light, the cars that were next to me are about two or more car lengths away.  The freeway is unbelievable.  I took my new pony out for the maiden voyage about 1:00 AM as I live in Southern California where the traffic is horrible.  I wanted to take my new car out for a spin.  I couldn't believe how fast that car can go with little to no effort.  I had the car up to 105 mph but didn't even know it until I looked at the speedometer.  It felt like I was going about 70.  It handles incredibly.  This car just hugs the road and is fantastic when making a fast turn.  Okay, so I drive like a nut, but this car has airbags all over the place, a long hood, so it should hold up extremely well in the event something should happen.  The safety reviews were five stars. All of my former Mustangs were totaled, one of which went upside down.  As the human Mustang test dummy, the Mustangs hold up extremely well in accidents.  Since this Mustang has a lot more safety features than my old ones, I'm sure it is extremely sound, The exterior is just gorgeous, and I especially like the hood. Overall the car seems longer and wider than my other Mustangs.  The keyless entry is great.  You don't even have to take the keyless remote out of your handbag (or pocket) to open the car. You simply grab the handle, and the car magically opens.  To lock it, you close the door and place a finger on the end of the handle, and the car locks.  I'm 57 and can get in and out of the car very easily.   Now for the interior.  I bought it with the basic package, but the basic package has all the amenities I want and/or need.  I lied except for one thing, neither of the front seats are power.  The other Mustangs had a power driver's seat.  Then again, I was playing with the all the front seat adjustments.  If you like your seat in one place which most people do, the no power seats is not a problem.  Actually it seems the seats are very adjustable.  As far I can tell the seat goes forward and all the way back to the back seats!  Therefore, if you happen to be tall, I can't see there being a problem with the car being too small.  The seats also go up and down, and the back of the seat is also adjustable.  The basic package come with cloth seats. Doesn't everyone want leather; well, I got the basic package.  My car came with the ruby red exterior with what they call ebony seats.  The seats are dark, but they are not jet black.  I'm going to say it's a very pretty shade of a dark gray. I love it, and the seats are very comfortable as well.  It has Bluetooth which to me is a luxury from my 2004.  It is so cool!  It plays the songs off my iPhone.  Today I tried calling a friend, and I could them extremely well, and the controls are on the steering wheel in an accessible place.  My car also will read your speed from 0 to 60 etc.  That is a must for me to try out when I'm not in a busy traffic area.  In the manual I believe it has paddle controls on the steering wheel in the event you want to drive it like a manual transmission - I don't so won't be using that perk.  I almost forgot about the tilt steering wheel. I tried it out last evening.  I was so impressed.  That wheel not only tilted but you can also adjust the distance of the wheel.  I moved the steering wheel closer to me and lowered it a bit.  Now it really feels like I'm driving a race car.  I'm extremely glad I didn't get the V8 as the V6 has all the power I will ever need.  I highly recommend this car. I've only owned mine for two weeks, but it is so much fun to drive.  I really love it and anyone who buys this car surely will too!",2017,Marca_A,2017-12-08,2017,12,8,Friday

It is silver and  is beautiful to look at and well engineered by Ford. I love the smoothness and power of the V6.  The car is a pleasure to drive around town or on the highway. It feels solid and sounds great with a slight rumble, especially on start up. I think Ford has made a huge mistake in phasing out the V6 in the Mustang for 2018. If anything, Ford should tweak the engine a bit more to keep up with the Camaro V6. I chose the Mustang over the Camaro for its looks , styling and better visibility and pricing. I chose the ingot silver and have had lots of compliments on the car at gas stations and parking lots, etc. I am thrilled with every aspect of this car except for the lack of leg room in the back seat and the lack of a spare tire. Ford seems to think an air pump in the trunk will get you home rather than providing a donut spare tire. I ordered a spare tire on line which is happily in my trunk in the event of a flat.  Ford needs to reevaluate sending its customers out on the road without the proper equipment to drive home safely. Great car, great pricing, great engineering. Be sure  to ask for a spare tire before you conclude your deal for a new or used 2017 V6 Mustang!

352,4,"The longer I own it the less I like it. I've owned the car about a month and while I still love the car I feel that Ford cheaped out on a few things. My biggest beef is that while cleaning the black wheels this evening with a wash cloth it scratched the wheels. This was just an average run of the mill CLEAN wash cloth and it put micro scratches in the finish. It is going to be an added cost to clear coat them so the finish lasts longer than a few months. I'm not using the cheap cloth seat belt loops so the seat belt has started to leave little scuff marks on the driver door where it knocks against it when I take the seat belt off. This is my fourth Mustang and even when I haven't used the seat belt loops in the past the belt did not mar up the door like it is in this car. The console gets HOT! Don't expect to keep a cold drink cold in the cup holders because there is a severe shortage of insulation under there. The manual shifter is clunky and unimpressive and I will swap it out as soon as I can. I'm a tall guy and it's a long way getting in and out but that's the price you pay for a car of this sort. Great power and ride is good for a sporty muscle car, not to smooth but not too rough either. I have a sneaking suspicion that the cheap plastic trim pieces will not hold up well over time, especially if you use the car alot (which I won't be). Stereo is sufficient but unimpressive. I purchased the black out option, spare tire and black roof and am overall happy with my purchase. Since I baby my car and only drive it about 6 months out of the year it should hold up fine.

The V6 has plenty of power and the transmission shifts at just the right times.  The independent rear suspension is great and provides an aggressive yet comfortable ride.  Although I haven't put too many miles on the car yet, averaging 24.5 mpg with a 60/40 mix of in-town and freeway driving.  This is great.   The interior is very good with soft materials where you want them and the seats are very supportive and comfortable.  Impressive implementation of the instrumentation.  I am sad that this is the last year for the V6 as it is a great engine and is a fantastic performer.  I found the 4cyl loud under load and at times clumsy on the test drive and I feel Ford is making a big mistake removing the V6 from the engine lineup.   Overall, I have a big smile on my face and am enjoying the ride.  I am looking forward to putting the mustang through its paces on a trip this summer on route 66.",2017,Marca_A,2017-05-17,2017,5,17,Wednesday

359,2,"Looks & drives nice, but........ Check out your car very well before purchasing. It is obvious that Ford still does not care about quality after all of these years & why I avoided them for most of my life. The car I have is twisted. The driver's side door is warped. The hood is extremely hard to open because it barely opens far enough to get small fingers underneath to get to the release. The body lines do not line up. The dealership could do nothing about this and the repairs will require a body shop. I know this is a bad car that I bought, but these things should have been caught by Ford before being released from the factory! It wasn't noticed by me until I got the car home & really went over it that evening. The dealer is doing it's best to get it fixed by getting it to the right people, but it really should go back to Ford & I should get a replacement car. Other than the body/frame issues, the car drives great, handles great, looks great, nice power @ 305 HP, decent fuel economy and the front seats are comfortable. Can't say much for the back seat. The rear seats look great, but are useless. A child couldn't even sit back there. At least the trunk is very roomy.

360,5,"GT PREMIUM WITH PERFORMANCE PACK I bought this car in December of '16 after a wait of over 2 years. This is my third Mustang i have owned in the last 35 years. This car has really matured since my old '86 gt I had years ago. The car is larger and drives larger than both my '86 and my '02 GT I had to sell before buying this Mustang, yet it far out handles both of them (my 02 GT had about 4k in aftermarket upgrades in both engine mods and suspension).  The only real complaint about the car is the ingress and egress for me. I am 6'4"" and you have to be fairly flexible to get in and out. Once you are in though, the car fits like a glove, the shifter falling right into place, the steering wheel can be adjusted to taste and everything is very simple to use. The standard leather seats are outstanding, and after taking a 6-1/2 hour trip up to Napa from So. Cal, the seats gave my wife and I plenty of support and the heating and cooling feature is great! As for the performance...my mustang is plenty quick, but I don't drive it to be a drag racer. I wanted a true GT. The handling is more than adequate with the performance package, and the six piston Brembos are superlative. There is a reason why Mustangs have been around for over 50 years. Ford has obviously found a formula of performance, comfort, and style and blend it together in a fashion that other American car manufacturers try to emulate, but always come up short in one or more of these categories, missing the mark on Ford's pony car and what it represents.Edmunds has requested that I update my review of my Mustang GT Premium with the performance package. Here you go. Everything I wrote in the above original comments 8 or 9 months ago, still holds true. This car is a pleasure to drive and it puts a smile on my face every day. Rowing through the gears in Southern California with or without traffic has never been so much fun. I have had the opportunity to let others drive it and they all walk away saying, ""Nice drive!"" or ""This car is some serious fun!""  Of course, like me, they also have a smile on their faces after they are done driving it.",2017,Marca_A,2017-01-23,2017,1,23,Monday
361,5,"Zoom zoom, 2017 Ford Mustang, 5.0 Automatic I test drove the Chevy Camaro, Dodge Challenger, and Nissan 370Z.  All the listed had advantages and disadvantages. Also read several magazine articles/reviews, which favored the Mustang as a daily driver, and then took the Mustang for a few more test drives and for me the Ford Mustang 5.0 GT Premium, black on black with blacked out emblems and automatic transmission won hands down.  All around a more driver friendly car, but definitely still plenty of muscle for the road to include back roads.  Felt more comfortable for the longer drives, and the fit and finish to include a nicely appointed interior definitely sold me to the Ford.  I don't consider myself a Ford guy, but after driving the Mustang I decided I had to own one.  To date I've driven it to the NYC area, and it was very comfortable for three hours each way, and very soon to Daytona to attend the Rolex 24.  I've only owned it since late December 2016 so there are a number of areas on this survey I can't yet speak to...but I'm definitely hoping they are just as strong in the positive as my experience so far.UPDATE: Sold the 2017 and purchased a 2018 Ford Mustang loaded with all the new bells & whistles.  New 2018 GT Premium, also in Black, 10 speed transmission, active exhaust, magnadrive suspension, full digital instrumentation, performance package, etc. 1200 miles since purchase.UPDATE: Still very happy with the 2018 Mustang overall, but hugely disappointed on how overly difficult it is to get money back regarding the extended warranty.  Bought the 18 model last November 2017, and have had to get the the Ford Warranty division via snail mail.  They provided no other contact method other than snail mail.  If I had it to do over again I would not have ever purchased the extended warranty. My advice at this point unless you really know that you will keep the car for as long as the purchased warranty, DON'T do it.  At this point I'd give them a bunch of choice words.  The person who I've had some email contact with recently won't provide any updates to me.  I've provided all the necessary documents, and now nothing.  You mean to tell me this information wasn't in the system?  This is definitely poor, poor, business practices, and likely the second and last Ford I'll ever buy.  Enjoying the car, but at this point hating the company.  They will take all your money in a heart beat, and then make it time consuming, and nearly impossible to hold them accountable.

362,5,"Best Mustang Ever I just received my 2017 Mustang GT Premium that was ordered back in March.  I ordered it with the performance package, premium leather and the 6 speed manual transmission.  This is my first Mustang that I have ordered and I do have to say the wait was longer then I expected.  When the car finally came in, the dealer was excellent in getting it ready for me to pick up.  The interior is very nice and well thought out - the only down side is there is not a whole lot of room in the back seats.  That is about the only negative I can say about the interior.  I ordered the premium leather with the red accents and they are very comfortable and look GREAT!  The 5.0 Coyote is one strong motor.  It has all the power and go that you will need.  Very strong and very quick.  When you step on it, it wakes up and you will be through the gears before you know it.  Very impressed.  All I can say, Ford did a wonderful job on this car.  This is a true American Muscle Car.  It is built from the ground up to be a Mustang and no other chassis in the Ford line up shares any parts of it.

363,4,"Ford makes a good mustang? Yes, They do! finally a mustang for modern America.  With the new suspension in the rear this car drives! Instead of the old mustangs where going into a corner meant ending up at the coroner's, this mustang lets you power through in control. Fun to drive with a stiff but yet forgiving ride.  Can't wait to take this to the track, both the drag and the road track. This does not however mean it's all roses for the new mustang.  The interior leaves you wanting and thinking why? For example there are very few fake aluminum-plastic lookalike pieces, 5 switches 2 accents and the cowling around each primary air vents. With so few of these items why not use real aluminum? It would have increased the cost by 60 bucks so it leaves me saying why? Secondly the GT coyote engine suffers from a lack of tech. Ford makes the all amazing ford GT which has an engine that has the capability to turn off cylinders, and has the red light ""stop start"" function, these or at the very lest the ""stop start"" should be a must for this engine and would help massively with fuel eco.  That being said the noise the cayote engine makes and the power it produces is something that must be experienced to believe!Two year update:Mods:X-force Mustang GT cat-back exhaust.Piston support for the hood.Rouche open air intake.I am still in love with my mustang, and now with the adjustable exhaust it can be extremely aggressive or, for my neighbours quiet and restrained. The open air intake completes the engine bay along with the support pistons for the hood I no longer need the hood prop stick.  Taken a few long road trips and this is the mustang you want.. some times the computer is not the greatest system but with Apple car play I rarely interface with the base systems. Any negatives would be one of the plastic trunk latch covers has broken off, but I use this mustang to transport 2x4(s) for home projects and servers from DC to DC so I use and abuse the trunk and with all that use one broken plastic cover is honestly a surprise I was expecting far worse. An improvement would be soft touch closing trunk would be awesome and a sun/moon roof or all glass roof like the Jag F type would put this mustang over the top.  Two years in and my opinion has not changed the 2017 mustang GT is the best mustang that has been made since 1968, and well worth anyone’s consideration!

368,3,"Great Rental Car but would hate to own When driving the hood design is very high up and parts of the hood block your view.  Track and Sport mode pretty much cannot be used on the street unless you like cruising at 4-5K Rpm.  Normal mode is nice however.  With traction control off you really cannot spin the tires due to excessive amount of turbo lag and poor low end torque range.  There is so much information in the computer, most of which you will never use and some basic information like a digital display of speed is missing.  Now for a convertible driving with either the top up or down is pretty quiet and comfortable. This is a 30 day rental so I have put it through the paces.  For 300+ Hp and Torque plus turbo you would expect more.  My old 2003 Nissan 350 with 287hp would have destroyed this car.  Last thing that is really disappointing.

372,4,"A Pound for Pound Bargain My overall rating would have been higher had the V8 engine been available with a shutdown feature at highway speeds to increase overall mileage. The Corvette has it. I bought the car 9/7 and put 10K miles on it by 3/1. It came with the 265/35/20 tires and they really hold the road. Replacements will be in  the close to $300 each range but they have a 500 wear rating and roll out smooth. The pre-settings on the driver power seat allows for easy exit and entrance. The interior is well done and high quality. The car is surprisingly quiet with top up or down. I bought the Mustang because I need as much trunk space as possible for my trips and unlike the hardtop convertibles, the Mustang top folds onto itself with no intrusion into an almost full size trunk. The top goes up and down quietly and fast. I downgraded the Navigation system because there is no way to alphabetize your Favorites or eliminate previous destinations individually. There is a myriad of options in the gauges and lighting features. The engine data that is displayed is far beyond the average driver. The car is a bargain in today's market.

375,5,"Not a replacement, but a whole new automobile! Update: I had to trade in this car on a new Honda CRV Touring.  I just could not get out of it any more. My joints were in rebellion, so I am just too old (68) for this car with deep and low bucket seats.  In fact, when I showed the CRV to my Aunt and Uncle, they went and traded in their Lincoln Town Car on the exact same thing. My Aunt was able to get out with no effort at all with her bad knees. That is the ONLY problem I had with using the 2017 Mustang, but it was enough.  It also depreciated heavily in 7 months, from $42K to $24K KBB trade!  That part is disgusting, but you get nothing for all the add-ons...beware! Otherwise, as my personal car, it was the best car I ever owned for fun and for comfortable traveling while in it. So read on...Original review starts here:  I loved my 2014 Mustang convertible (read the review), so I got a new 2017 to have all of the active safety features and other convenience tech. What I got was something that is a huge step up in quality.  In fact, a different machine, with the feel of the BMWs (Mustang handles better in my opinion - test them) I tested and a huge leap above a Camaro.  It accelerates smoothly up to 121 mph (where it is electronically limited), gets up to 32 mpg on highway (with super unleaded, about 29-30 with regular).  Handles much better than the GT (again, try them out side by side - I did several times - GT feels front heavy and bulky). This drives like a sports car, nimble and quick (fun). And with a rear diffuser it hugs the road tighter at really higher speeds (over 100 mph) that I couldn't get near with the 2014 b/c the front end would start feeling lighter and drifting. Has plenty of storage, something lacking in the old Mustang and non-existent in Camaros.  The only things lacking is automatic braking (something I will demand in 3 years or I will switch models), and lane warning/assist.  The forward collision warning is great, but it just pre-loads brakes, probably a nod to the general macho among Mustang owners, but auto braking should be an option for those of us more concerned with being alive (and the safety of others) than imagined macho.  Another after market add on is a windscreen, which really makes a difference if you want to communicate or listen to the radio at highway speed.  It makes your car a two seater when in place, but I never have more than one lady friend at a time riding! :)  Easy to remove, but don't get this car for a backseat anyway.  One small feature I love is the center console which locks when you hit the door lock fob.  I leave the top down a lot when I go into a store. This combined with alarms keeps stray hands out that stuff.  All in all, a wonderful car.  After owning 6 convertibles and 4 of them Mustangs, this is way far best.",2017,Marca_A,2016-12-18,2016,12,18,Sunday
376,5,"The Ecoboost Premium Convertible I noted most reviews were for GTs.  I own an Ecoboost Premium Convertible.  Acceleration is so-so.  Handling is incredible.  Only two complaints are the windows controls are too far forward and the antenna is awkward if you have a car cover but it unscrews solving that.  Radio actually works fine without it screwed back in.  The rear seats cannot be used for passengers but I knew that in buying it.  They do make good interior storage - something the old Z-3 I had was short of.  Gas mileage is killer.  I saw acceleration is ""so-so"" only due to my last car, a Lincoln LS with the V-8, being no slouch so the Ecoboost doesn't seem to add anything to that.  Compared to something else maybe it'd be more impressive.  So niggling complaints on what has proven to be an incredibly handling car with enough pop to satisfy.

They aren't unreasonably slow but considering its a flagship v8 they are a bit slow vs their rival camaro.  These seem to be more of a tuner car ie people modify the looks to suit their taste and they typically don't care about being faster than their rivals or they just think they are faster but in fact are much slower.  The cars look great and are reasonably fast and priced well for what it is vs a camaro of the same year.  Ultimately you get what you paid for though.

381,4,"14 GT Up to task! So this is my 3rd GT, 1st was an '05 automatic which was bulletproof. 2nd was an '07 manual 5spd, great car. In Oct. '15 picked up this '14 used with 37k miles. Got a nice deal. Mileage was kinda high but I'm hoping this one will last me at least 4 more yrs. Have 65k miles now. So far this car has been great! Only real complaint is the clunky 2 piece transmission. It clunks sometimes going from 1st to 2nd gear and occasionally  3rd gear, especially driving normal. like just cruising around town. Also, when sitting in neutral, then shifting into 1st there is a thump. I was told the center carrier bearing was worn out because it flexes up and down, but I believe it does that purposely because of the 2 piece design. The car is rated at 420 HP, so power at the rear wheels is probably more like 380, maybe less, like 350. Despite the clunky trans, I've got 65k miles and she's been rock solid so far. I had to do a lot of driving for a sick relative where I was driving almost 3k a month for 4 months. Gas MPG went up during those trips. I was averaging almost 27-28 mpg, which I think is good for today's muscle car.  Definitely fun to drive, I just added Borla stingers on 8/2/17 and I'm so glad I did! Wow! I had MagnaFlow before which were ok, but the Borla really clears her throat, with no drone either!!!!! I'm not gonna complain about the backseat or plastics in the interior. I didn't buy it for that. I will say no spare tire. I need to address that. If I get a flat, then I'll be waiting for the Tow truck. I'll probably buy one soon. If your looking for a V8 muscle car on a budget, I'd say the mustang gt will check every box you need. Challengers are heavier, you can't see out of the Camaro's. Mustang's have the right mix of streetability and performance with bang for your buck. As far as gas goes, I usually run 87, then 91 every 5th tank or so. I always run full synthetic oil. Usually get about 7500-8500 miles between changes.",2014,Marca_A,2017-08-04,2017,8,4,Friday
382,4,"Great car for the money I purchased my 2014 GT (base) manual trans with only 3,000 miles on it in November, 2016.  Guy before me drove it 1,000 miles every year for the first three years, and decided to trade it in for a Ford Escape.  I've put a tad over 3,000 miles on it myself, and have added a Roush axleback exhaust, Barton short throw shifter w/ two piece mounting bracket, and aftermarket 20"" staggered wheels/tires.  I was surprised to see so few reviews on this model car considering it is already 3 years old. My impressions so far:  The car is a great bang for your buck sports car.  The power is NOT immediate, though, when you step on the gas.  As another reviewer noted, you'll need to get the engine above 4k rpm to really notice any significant pull.  Below 4k rpm the car seems sluggish.  But if you are on the highway and shift down and get in that rpm range above, 4k, you will NOT think the car is sluggish anymore :).  If you go with the manual trans, YOU WILL NEED to get an aftermarket shifter.  I've driven tons of manual trans vehicles in my life and the stock shifter on my 2014 mustang gt may have been THE WORST shifter out of any car I've ever driven.  HORRIBLE feel, long shifts, MISSED shifts (even when not 'getting on it'), and inferior parts make up the qualities of the stock shifter.  I purchased a Barton shifter with two piece bracket that mounts to the trans.  My good friend and I installed in about an hour or hour and a half.  NIGHT AND DAY difference.  The Roush axleback exhaust is also highly recommended, and I also installed that myself.  Again, night and day difference.  Quiet when cruising with zero highway drone, but open her up and it's pure bliss.  Overall the car could use-in my opinion-a lower ride height from the factory.  Interior quality is meh....lots of hard plastics.  But who cares, I bought a Mustang, not a luxury car.  I cannot attest to reliability yet, because my car is only sitting at 6,200 miles.  Factory LED headlights and fog lights are BRIGHTEST lights I've ever had in any car.  I mistakenly drove the whole way home with just the fogs on one night.  Didn't even realize it until I got into my driveway.  They are truly that bright (and I get high beamed every time I drive the car b/c people think the fog lights are high beams and it must hurt their eyes...).  If you are looking for a good performance car for the $$, go for the 2014 Mustang GT.  You won't be disappointed.  A few things are a must to modify (see shifter comment...), but that's the case in most cars.  Hope this review helps.  Oh, I don't daily drive mine (anything but...), but I combine to get around 16.5 mpg, and that's with some spirited driving.",2014,Marca_A,2017-07-13,2017,7,13,Thursday

Engine - Excellent rendition of a smooth Japanese V8 with DOHC and VTec, but it lacks the torque and immediacy of the old 5.0L small block.  You will need to rev the engine well beyond 4k rpm to realize any benefit over a V6 sedan.  Transmission - The 6 speed MT-82 Getrag is a huge disappointment.  Not only is it produced in China with inferior parts and construction, but the shifter is remotely mounted making  gear changes a nightmare when the vehicle is side loaded.  When you combine the remote mounted shift mechanism with the stock Turkish sourced clutch assembly (that can't handle the full rpm range of the engine) you end up with a non-performer.  Expect to be locked out of gear while the clutch pedal sits stuck to the floor anytime you're shifting over 6k rpm with the stock components.  Attached to the transmission is a heavy two-piece driveshaft, which was needed when Ford went to the short MT-82.  The clunks you will hear during stop and go traffic are caused by its excess weight and play in the joint.  Some people are able to adjust their clutch engagement method to dampen the severity of the noise.  Brakes - Find a model with the track package containing up-sized Brembo calipers.  The stock GT brakes are adequate once you get used to the soft squishy pedal sinking to the floor on hard stops.  Steering - This model came with numb electric power steering.  There are 3 modes to adjust the weight, but the system just reduces the electric assist instead of providing actual feedback.  Don't hop from a sports car into the Mustang expecting a road course ready car.  Ford provides a good engine with a car wrapped around it and expects the owner and aftermarket suppliers to perform the engineering and troubleshooting that should have been done at the factory.  All the problems have solutions, but not all owners will have the time or money to implement them.",2014,Marca_A,2017-06-13,2017,6,13,Tuesday
384,5,"After 3 years, no regrets! On the 4th of July weekend, 2014, I went shopping for a new sports car.   My budget was under $25k, not including my $9k trade-in.  The V6 Camaro was the easiest to drive, but lacked visibility.  The Dodge Challenger was the smoothest ride but only the V6 was within my budget.  The Mustang GT has a 420 HP V8, 6 speed auto, and was the same price as the other two and way more fun to drive.  Looking back over the last three years I have no regrets.  I think my 2014 'live axle'  GT looks better, sounds better, is quicker in the 1/4 mile straight run, and feels like it has more room for the driver, than the 'independent rear' 2015+ model Ford replaced it with.  The Ford Mustang GT is the 'most-bang-for-the-buck' new muscle car you can buy today.",2014,Marca_A,2017-06-13,2017,6,13,Tuesday

Eibock lowering springs and Bilstien shocks make performance of suspension 100% better.  This 5.0 is the best motor that Ford has ever made.  Back seat is just not roomy enough.  Recarro seats are perfect in front.  Overall this is a fun car to drive.  Fuel milage is terrible around town but I have gotten as high as 29mpg on the interstate..  One complaint I have is that the rev limiter comes up too fast. For the price this is a good performance car..,2014,Marca_A,2017-02-01,2017,2,1,Wednesday
387,5,"Fun Fast Ride! I read a lot about Mustangs being I've owned mine for over 2 years and they seem to get a bad rap.  I however love mine and wouldn't trade it for anything else unless I could get the same performance out of a 5th generation Firebird as I love their look.  I've had no troubles or concerns with this car except the visibility of seeing who's beside you on the road.  I got used to using the spot mirrors that came with the car so that's not really an issue anymore.  I've made some tight turns and have traversed from one edge of the road to the other and the car handles with finesse.  As to what those other crazies are doing out there causing accidents, I don't know.  Perhaps they're bad drivers.  The performance wasn't exactly to my liking as I wouldn't preferred an V8 GT but didn't want to pay all the extra cash for one.  True this car is limited to 118mph but if you get yourself a digital tuner, you can take that off.  Thus far I'm am sitting happy with a sport tune with speed limit set to around 130mph and cold air intake which I modified myself for max flow and a set of Goodyear TripleTreds for any driving condition.  I am good to go!  If I have money someday I'll get a higher endurance drive shaft, higher speed rated tires, headers and exhaust as well as a spoiler and a sport stripe.  But for now I'm happy as I can beat most cars on the road and ride in comfort when I feel like cruising.  I've only been beaten by a higher profile BMW, Mercedes Benz, and a Charger R/T that someone obviously forked out a lot of cash to increase performance.  Heck, my brother has one with racing tires, tune, and cyclone cold air intake and beat him.. wasn't easy.. he had me off the line but I caught up to him.  All in all this is a great performance car and I tire of all the people who have something bad to say about it.  Hey I respect all vehicles:  Camaros, Chargers, Challengers, Lancers, Imprezas, etc... I like them all but I love my car and it's a blast.  Someday I'll have to take it to the track.  Tried at Chuckawala but never got around to getting the gear which includes a racing helmet and suit and a fire extinguisher.  I just wanted to lap it around a couple times and compare it to the others that have done so. LOL  All I can do now it race others on the street when both them and I feel like it, but that's in open conditions with other people on the street = not safe.  Sorry getting off topic here. LOL.. in a nutshell it's a good well rounded speedy car which can become a monster if you know how to tap into its resources.  Thanks for listening.",2014,Marca_A,2017-01-08,2017,1,8,Sunday
388,5,"Mustang Expert Ok so I bought my car in 2014 when it was ""brand new"" so ive had it somewhere between 2-3 years and the odometer sits at 38,000 currently. It is a v6 3.7, the power that these cars put out for what it is is phenomenal. It is beyond a step of the older generations of course. I have raced GT v8s of the older gens and have either stayed equal or passed them up by a bit which is quite impressive considering those don't get the gas mileage that I get. The interior of the car is great but definitely could be better, if youre comparing to the 2015+ years then it feels old and outdated of course but its still a great and comfortable interior. The only downside id say about the interior is that the plastic does creek, its annoying but probably repairable if youre dedicated enough as well as not much back seat space but if you bought or are buying this car for a family car then you need to get your priorities straight. Another thing that kind of bothered me is my water pump went out at about 30k miles (probably just faulty from factory because others never had that issue) and my warranty covered it so I cannot hold that against Ford. But if there is one thing that I do hold a grudge is that my local dealer has poor customer service, and it seems that everytime I go there its a bunch of nonsense with them but I digress. Overall if youre looking to get the best of both worlds for a sports car that you can daily drive then this is your car, the options you can throw on later down the line if you choose is almost endless, they make performance and styling parts for this car like crazy so you could always make your ride unique to you if you choose to, and its pretty affordable to if youre comparing it to other things out there.",2014,Marca_A,2016-11-28,2016,11,28,Monday
389,4,"Car is great. Interior, not so much. I had an '05 GT premium throughout college and beyond. Red with red leather interior... it was BEAUTIFUL. And until the transmission blew after just 80K miles, it drove like a dream. After shelling out $2k+ for a new tranny, I decided to bid adieu to my beauty and get something more practical. I guess I used that term loosely because that was a '14 Mustang V6. As far as the engine goes, the only thing I missed about the V8 was its rumble. The V6 has more than enough power and is fun to drive!However, the interior is a different story. My advice to anyone looking to buy a 2014 is to pay the extra grand or so and get a premium. It is WORTH IT. I made a big mistake by getting the base model. I thought it would be OK because I'm not really into all the bells and whistles, especially on a Mustang (it's all about that engine, right?!) , but the quality of the interior is horrible. Everything is plasticy and cheap: the chrome accents in the dash are plastic (really, Ford?), the dash also looks like someone just snapped it together, there's big gaps everywhere. Because of this, it makes a ton of noise. Every time I pinpoint and fix a rattle in the dash, a new one emerges. I used to love to turn off my radio so I could listen to the engine, but now I have to blast music when i drive so the constant rattling doesn't drive me nuts. I'm at the point where I want to sell the car. Ford, please fix this in future Mustangs. The base models don't need all the bells and whistles, but they deserve to be made with quality that matches what's under the hood.",2014,Marca_A,2016-06-05,2016,6,5,Sunday

Wife got this one and I picked up a 2010 with a v6 5speed.Hers has way more options and goodies on it and seeing her grin from ear to ear when we bought it made the whole process worth it.This car is up on power but let me say that with a stick these cars are nearly identical on acceleration. There are slight differences in the 2 bodies and the major ones come in the form of features... sequential tail lights, Bluetooth, sync... her car has enough to keep her spoiled with no navigation which isn't necessary for her.The zip from the motor is awesome and the cornering on hers is phenomenal.... very fun to drive :)Great job on the updates fordUPDATE 20171116:Have since purchased a different 2014 Mustang for my wife that has all the same basic features but added the track package with leather and had been upgraded visually only moderately. same basic car and still love the way it drives and handles. Still has all the same characteristics of the old car with more style and visual appeal. I'd like to imagine the car was so good we wanted a better version of it and now she has it :).since owning the last car we've found that with a really good set of tires it handles very well in the snow with minor slipping when you press the gas too hard and as long as the snow isn't over 6-7 inches there isn't really much to worry about as with any other car you may drive.other than that my review hasn't changed and its still a very amazing car",2014,Marca_A,2016-05-07,2016,5,7,Saturday

Even with the V6 and 2.73 rear end, the acceleration is unbelievable. It is not real fast until it hits high rpm's, so off the line it is not winning any races, but soon afterwards it will throw you back in your seat. The select shift is useless unless you shift at higher rpm's. In the low rpm range (under 2000), it will say you shifted on the dash, but it is lying.

A few days later he called me and said Ford wanted pictures from the inside, the sides and as it is raised and lowered.

Since, I have been calling to see where they are at on this situation as I do not want my children in the car, let alone myself, where the very function that is supposed to help you in an accident, ""could result in serious injury or death"" (as stated directly in the 2nd recall letter I received last week. I called Fords service division to discuss what they will be doing for their customers, and they said nothing but simply having us ""wait another 6 months for the part to slowly come in."" As the service lady stated on the phone to me. I think this is very irresponsible on Ford's part. Having their customers drive around a car that could put them at greater risk in an accident than the very accident itself. I feel it is unfair as a customer to be forced to drive under these conditions, or choose to sell or leave the car in the garage knowing the risks of driving it. Ford should allow customers who bought cars to return them or provide us with safer vehicles in the meantime until these issues are fixed.",2014,Marca_A,2016-06-09,2016,6,9,Thursday

I purchased this convertible with 32,000 miles on it and have since put about 20,000 miles on it. It is very difficult for me to let it stand still in the garage. I love driving this car so much. I have driven a pick up, an economy car, luxury car and German sports car, and the Mustang is the best road handling of the bunch. The acceleration is incredible, the braking is strong, and the fuel economy averages about 23-24 in town. Driving with the top down brings you much closer to nature especially living in a place like Central Florida. It can get super hot outside, but it is difficult or me to not want to put the top down. This car definitely draws the looks of passers by and the admiration of others who have not realized their dream of Mustang ownership. So far, I have not had any mechanical issues to attend to. I purchased a Ford Factory Extended Warranty and so far it has gone unused.",2014,Marca_A,2015-07-23,2015,7,23,Thursday

423,5,"Still a Great Fun Car for my 84 year old friend! This is an update:  I unfortunately had to sell my 2017.  Became too hard to get out of.  I loved it in every other way, but was hurting my joints, the bucket seat is so deep and low.  I got a 2017 Honda CRV Touring new (#1 class rating), and I love it.  It's not a convertible (but has a sunroof). All in all, I really like it and my Aunt and Uncle liked it so well, for the same reasons, they traded in their Lincoln Town Car and bought a new CRV, the same as mine, top of the line. Apparently they liked it!!! Haha! PS - I got $24K for my 7 month old Mustang, paid $42K for it.  Terrible depreciation - 43%. KBB by owner price = $27K, which still stinks. Be forewarned: they allow NOTHING for all those extra whistles and bells. I expect the Honda to really hold value.  Still, was worth the taking the beating to feel and walk better.Original reviews follow: I had a white convertible, medium stone interior since I live at a warm beach.  This is an update, since I sold it to an 83 year old gentleman who is having the time of his life with it.  50K miles with only one A/C issue so far. I retired from work in Alaska, so I wanted all the fresh air and sunshine I could get to make up for all the time spent indoors up in the land of the great outdoors (like most everyone I knew).  This car fills the bill.  Road trips are minimal in Alaska, but after 30 years of travel commuting I am staying home except for a trip to Atlanta last summer. However, I plan to go to Seattle to see my son next Spring, and maybe more trips after that. For that and other reasons I bought a brand new 2017 Mustang convertible. Mainly, this is due to all the new accident avoidance technology.  Decided on the Ecoboost and I couldn't be happier.   I got the Ecoboost without the performance package (for a smoother ride), but all electronics for $42K. Straight line acceleration above usable for merging isn't most important at my age, but I did take it up smoothly to the electronic-limited 121 mph once. The rear diffuser makes it hug the road even more at high speed. Gets up to 32 mpg on highway. It is a wonderful car.  Even my BMW friends are jealous. The open top is the main thing, and the GT noise would block out the birds singing.  But, if someone doesn't have the money to buy a new one, I recommend the 2014 highly.  Lots of fun for the money. It got me to the beach for my every morning walk with the early rays of sun on the water, and along the waterfront under the stars at night.  My older friend is still loving it and he brags to whoever will listen.  This is an update and he still loves that 2014.

The heater works great in the winter - no different than in any other car.  And as soon as the temps start to climb in the spring, down goes the top!   It is low to the ground, so getting in and out of the driver's seat definitely isn't for people with stiff backs.  Maintenance is pretty easy - the engine compartment is big enough to reach all of the spark plugs.

881,5,"First mustang, last v6 Bought this car on impulse and only had it a few months. To me, this car was not very impressive and had wished I got a v8. It had an airbag recall, a strange knocking in the dash (I guess a common thing) and the paint was peeling. The mustang was pretty big for me as well, I’m 5’2 and it felt like I was driving a boat. The cool things were that I could change the lights in the interior, the taillights were awesome. The resale value was ok, less than I paid for it of course. It’s a pretty car, but would never get a v6 again. Every time I’d see a v8 I’d honeslty feel like I was driving a fake mustang. This particular mustang also had bad breaks and something wrong with the suspension and alignment. The good would also go down with braking. Did not feel safe driving on highways. Could have just been this one. Superingly though this car has a lot of cargo space! It’s amazing!",2010,Marca_A,2018-02-12,2018,2,12,Monday
882,5,"A dream come true This is the only new car purchase I have ever made in my lifetime and probably will remain so.  I've always been a car guy since my infancy. The family up the street had a yellow '65 mustang with a black roof. I've been hooked ever since. I've owned several Mustangs including a 1979 GT and a '89LX 5.0 which became my daily driver for many years (over 235 thousand miles). My 2010 sleeps in the garage when not in use and it has never been in the rain or snow. It only gets driven on nice days and when I'm not in any hurry whatsoever. This beautiful resonant machine is my dream toy come true. I purchased it brand new in 2009 and it still looks completely new. I experienced a warranty problem with the clutch as several bolts were not torqued to spec at the factory. My dealership fixed it for free (including a brand new clutch) sometime around my third year of ownership. Anyway, I'll keep this car it for as long as I have the mental and physical faculties which allow me to drive. Thereafter, I hope that one or both of our children get to enjoy it.  I have made countless films and videos of it from every angle. It is solid and simple with no added scoops, louvers, fancy aftermarket wheels or other clutter.  Upon doing research to purchase it, I tried a variety of colors in the computer simulated car online and found that sunset gold was the color to go with. It's beautiful, daring different and it can be readily seen by distracted motorists who might be sharing the road with me.  Altogether, I adore the V8 grunt of this thing, the smell of the interior, trunk and underhood areas, the solid feel of the car and its great appearance and handling. The 4.6 V8 with the 3.73 rear end give me all I could ever ask for.  I have only 18k on it currently. Still, I feel like a kid on Christmas morning every time I pop into the garage,  get into it and crank it up. Cheers to Ford!!",2010,Marca_A,2017-06-27,2017,6,27,Tuesday

Great performance (3.73 option package with 19-inch Pirelli tires), outstanding gas mileage (24 highway), comfortable and high-tech interior and a great overall value.

What it didn't expect is it has also been our favorite car to take trips across the country. This car rides very comfortably and after hours on the road my back and legs are still fresh and not sore at all. The exhaust sound is a muffled roar on the inside which I like because it's not too loud, but at the same time it's rather loud if you standing near it while it drives by. I like this too because others instantly know it's a muscle car but I don't have to shout to talk to passengers. This car runs very smooth and has never given us any issues in 54,000 miles. The 5-speed manual is lots of fun and the only thing that's not perfect on this car as sometimes the shifter will get a little sticky between 2nd and 3rd gear.

888,4,"Great Base model Traded in our family car (2015 hyundai sonata) for 2ea mustangs with this being one.Let me say first off the v6 with the 4.0 and a 5-speed is one of the most solid setups these guys put together and it doesn't disappoint. Has great power and all but keeps up with my wifes 2014 with the v6 which is supposedly updated and has about 100hp on mine... hmmm lolInterior quality is lacking with hard plastic everywhere but it is a base model and this was bought with long range reliability in mind... and plastic won't rip or fade like leather haha.Seats are sufficient and almost exactly what I remember in my father's setup. Front passengers remain priority and the back has extremely limited  room with smaller seats... adequate for 1 person to stretch across both sides lol.Where this car shines is the exterior and performance. The outside of this car is beautiful in the super red and has more than enough giddy up to have a little fun. Turn off traction control and it gets even better without blowing through tires in the v8.Overall they did a great job with this... Base model is really set up for the pure enthusiast that doesn't need/want many bells and whistles that over time will fail... and everything that could be improved upon has in new models... amazing job on this one ford.***********************************UPDATE*******************************2016-12-15Had a few months to drive this car in all weather conditions and have a few extra notes to add.First off.... this car HATES the extreme cold of ND... I mean really. I know being up here I have to accept it and I did want it. That doesn't make it a deal breaker or bad, just a note... Now for further details:  1. The tranny in this car in the cold is really snotty. What I mean is it will be extremely hard to get into gear or after engaging and put my foot down it will occasionally pop out. I've learned to deal with this as once the car warms up completely the problem almost dissapears.2. The stock tires are still on this thing and were clearly meant for Summer. So unless you're experience at how a car handles get a better set of tires and leave traction on. For me, I am choosing to make it through the winter on these before replacing them with Pirelli's. For now, I just turn off traction control before I move as it actually takes away from the functioning of the car and being able to rock it and almost ANY amount of gas will make the wheels spin in any snow.3. Occasionally in the frigid cold that is ND, the engine will stall when coming to a stop of any sort and I need to restart the vehicle. This is in no part to do with any driving... it's just cold. I do run premium and will hopefully help solve this by Putting some Lucas in my engine next time I service it. My advice for now is unless you really know how to drive a car and can take something with a temper stay away from this one in extremely cold places. I am willing to trade hassle for handling in the warmer months and look to have this car for some time. For me, I'm willing to deal with all the above things as this car is rock solid and being able to drive it in this weather is a real feat some days, proving if I can do it anyone can. If you're in warmer weather you should absolutely LOVE this car. Nothing wrong with it.",2010,Marca_A,2016-05-07,2016,5,7,Saturday

Doing 80 on the freeway in a straight line, the car feels planted to the pavement, but if you hit any sort of uneven surface while turning above 30 mph, the experience is unsettling for both the car and driver.

I went online and this was a common issue in the 30,000+ mile range. Now, right after the 5 year engine warranty ended, the water pump is going out. Replacing that and the hoses is going to cost me another $1,000 if I do it at a dealer.                      WARNING: Worst of all with this car. If I had know this I wouldn't have purchased the car. The heat in Arizona is hard on batteries, once you get acid on the battery cable, it will get inside the wiring and slowly eat its way through everything until all your electronics are burned out too. Luckily I caught it before it damaged anything. It's a special cable that you can only get from the dealer and they have to drop the transmission to replace it. $1,000 to replace that. I asked the dealer and a local about other options and how to avoid it in the future. They said this faulty cable is the only option on the Mustang, and you can only slow the problem down, but that I'll probably be back in in 5 years with the same problem. ITS A BATTERY CABLE!

996,5,"Coming from a 3.7-V6, what a difference. I owned a 2013 Premium V-6 for just over 2 years and always felt behind the more powerful 5.0, so I tried to modify my v6 to make up for the lower power. 5,000 dollars later I was happy with the performance, but all the bolt on ruined dependability. So i stumbled across a used 2012 performance white Boss 302, with only 6K miles. It was way more than I wanted to spend (36,000 Out-the-door). But I ended up getting over book value for my car and the Boss for under blue book value. I have owned the Boss for a little over a month and have put around 750 miles on it. It's my first 6 speed, and the Boss was a great car to learn on. I haven't pushed the cars performance yet, so I'm getting 22.8 MPG average being relatively fuel minded (75% backroads 25% City), also I only run 93 octane. Being 19 years old, I'm not too concerned with features or comfort. But if you're looking for luxury and comfort, you better pass this car up. It lives up to it's track car name with stiff, but manageable ride quality. I have the restrictor plates on the side pipes removed, which makes a lot more noise and causes a slight drone. I think It's awesome though, now I won't need a aftermarket exhaust. There's a lack of entertainment/features but I think it gives what you need, and nothing more. How I define it when talking to other people about my car, is that they took all the money in interior add-on's, and put all the money into the engine and drive-train. With the longetivity of the coyote 5.0, but with forged internals and improved cooling (The Boss 302 engine is called RoadRunner Instead of coyote, since the only thing in common is the block) I think this car will last hundreds of thousands miles with proper maintenance, all while providing awesome performance, sound, looks, and adequate features.

The new V6 has awesome acceleration and can match the old V8 in terms of performance.The stock auto setup is a compromise though.For general driving the Mustang is sweet.When you want to unleash the beast,there is throttle lag and imprecise gear shifts until you get above 3500 rpm,then she pulls like a train.

Now my car will be in the shop for over a week while I’m here which means I cannot return home when I had planned. Evaporator coil went bad and they have to order it. Will take 3 days to get here. My car was dropped off at dealership after a two day wait on appointment. They finally got my car in to look at it the following day cause they were backup with other service work. It’s Saturday now and I’m hoping to get it back late next week. So to say I am unhappy is an understatement. Plus no loaner or rental. Just a shuttle back to my brothers house to wait.

1012,4,"After 62,850 miles, I’ll miss her, but... I bought my based 2016 mustang gt in June of 2016. The only option was the performance package, which I highly recommend. 3.73 factory gears, big brakes go a long way for the performance of this car. One good/bad thing about this option was the 275/40-19 tires in the back. Great because if you like cornering, don’t mind drifting a bit when you shift on a corner or good sticky tires for a rock solid launch. Not great if you like tire life, and like to rotate your tires. If you’re buying a mustang and do NOT put a lot of miles on it like I do (daily driver, I’m in sales,) then I highly recommend sticking with the factory set up. The wheels and tires feel engineered for the car, and eliminate body roll on cornering. On the OTHER hand, I purchased a set of California GT wheels and tires (factory take-offs) from a guy and was able to rotate my tires (255/40-19’s all the way around.) This eliminated control a bit on the corners, but I still had great straight line speed. Under factory warranty, I had to have all 4 front (upper and lower) control arms replaced due to a rattle in the suspension at about 34K miles. They also had to replace the blower motor. I first noticed the varying speed of the air blower (a/c mostly) at 8k miles, and then documented it on film twice and took it back. They did pay for the entire repair even though by then I had about 48K miles on the car, since I showed a history of the problem. I just traded it in this weekend with 63k miles (approx.) After replacing the spark plugs and cleaning the injectors, I still had a periodic rough idle. Might be much of nothing, but I was concerned I was losing compression. Did I drive the piss out of this car? At 44 years old, absolutely! But my 2005 mustang with a procharger (575 hp) had 113k miles when I sold it (60k of it supercharged) and I NEVER had any problems with this car. My recommendation? But a S197 mustang (ideally 2013/2014) with low miles. They’re almost a half second quicker in the quarter mile, and it’s better build and proven platform (2005 to 2014.)",2016,Marca_A,2018-02-12,2018,2,12,Monday

The 4.2' screen is not much of a help actually (just about solves the purpose). But having to punch a number pad to change radio stations and for other stuff when technology today has reached beyond space is downright appalling! And there is no additional upgrade package for a V6 model where one can opt for the 8' screen and get rid of that idiotic number pad.

The big turn off for us was the level of road noise. I felt this may have been related to the tires installed on the car, but we would not purchase any car with this level of road noise.

But when the nightmare comes, one hot summer morning, the AC started to act really strange. It is blowing hot air on driver side, and warm air on the passenger side. Took it to dealer to fix... It took couple days for them to finish replacing the Evaporator (That's what they said was failed.) Have to go through the hassle of driving to another location for a rental car, as the dealer does not have any loaners on the lot, which wasted us a lot of times and ordination. Then it come back to us, and worked for another 2 or 3 month. Then suddenly last week, AC started to blow hot air again... We took it to dealer AGAIN and this time it took them 3 days to fix, and they told us the problem was the Evaporator AGAIN... Well thank god this car is only a 2 year lease.

The bad part was that the dealer said the vibration was normal for a Mustang. I had to talk to the dealership owner to get it fixed. I checked online and found out it is a common problem.

I didn't go for the Shelby because I didn't want my insurance company to punish me, but the GT is a pleasant surprise. I had a new Toyota Truck I traded in, and I did it because the ""Atkinson Cycle"" engine is so poor in response time when you press the gas pedal. How many times did you need a burst of speed to keep from having a car ram you because you turned onto the road and misjudged their speed because they were speeding up to keep you from turning in front of them (you know who you are). Sure, you might argue it's fun to crawl over and down hills, but I'm not an off-road person (honestly, how many people do that?). This GT put a smile on my face just driving it down the road. I didn't need to put the pedal to the floor, you cruise and maneuver knowing if you need it, the power is there (trust me).  After almost getting t-boned in my new truck with the response of a turtle I decided I wanted to stay alive. I decided to buy an American car to support our economy. American car companies know they have lagged in the market for years. That is why they have improved dramatically. You can dress it up as a sport car with stripes, or keep it simple. The burgundy color new Mustang looks awesome, almost like a Jaguar. The premium Shaker radio is great, although audiophiles will want to upgrade a door speaker or two, but it sounds great (you have to get the maximum speaker system I think it is 10 or 12). I always wanted a car that I didn't have to upgrade the stereo system. Even my Sirius subscription sounds good again. In my Tacoma, I thought it was the signal, but it was the stereo. Even the Tacoma JBL owners (a $2,000 upgrade) are upgrading the Tacoma speakers. I know this, it is complained about in Toyota forums. And the new Mustang technology is just fascinating. You can change the steering response, RPM engine response, interior lighting, set your seating positions for driver and passenger, and oh yes, you can open your garage door. I guess Toyota owners don't have garages, but driving up in my new truck WITH the technology package I had to wave my garage door opener around in the window! What the hell? There is so much to brag about, all I can say is we bought Toyota's and Honda's for years and this is the year of the American car. We are in America, let's start owning it. Buy American, you live here don't you? Don't listen to me, just go to the Toyota/Honda dealerships then go to American dealerships and see how far we have come. Even though my only complaint is the back seat, it won't matter with just me and my wife in the car. Check it out even if you're not planning on buying for a long time. I guarantee you will be impressed.  The ONLY problem with my experience is Ford customer service is not even close to Toyota/Lexus. With Ford, it's like pulling teeth to get something done that SHOULD BE DONE ANYWAY. Toyota/Lexus would TELL YOU BEFORE YOU SAW THE PROBLEM, SET AN APPOINTMENT FOR YOU, AND HAVE IT FIXED. It is disappointing to know they could do so much better if they would just emulate the competition's customer service procedures and attitudes. However, you only have to deal with their customer service a few times a year, you get to drive the car almost every day. As far as holding it's value, it really only matters how the car was maintained right? You can buy a used Toyota and not realize it never had the oil changed until the dealership changed it to resell it just as easy as a Mustang. Finally, it comes down to what you want. If you want luxury get a luxury car. If you want sporty get a Mustang. If you are going to want fast don't buy the Ecoboost 4 cylinder and put $10,000 into upgrading the engine, buy the V8 or Shelby. If you love stereo music don't buy the stock radio get the premium Shaker. I have ALWAYS spent at least $2,000+ and lots of time upgrading my car stereos, and this is the first time I don't feel the need to. It is a good feeling knowing I don't have cables and wires running under my carpet! Nobody can beat Focal/JL/Alpine but not having to rip my new door panels off is a good feeling. The bottom line is everyone complains about the economy in America then buys a Japanese car. Isn't it time to buy American? I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Just don't expect to be treated well after the sale.",2016,Marca_A,2016-06-11,2016,6,11,Saturday
1039,5,Awesome Car ! I recently purchased a v6 with the 051A package which is a must. You get the beautiful 18 inch  5 star wheels and 6 way power drivers seat. The car has great acceleration and very good steering feel. The ride is very good and the seat is comfortable. The car gets compliments everywhere I go especially when at the gas pumps.,2016,Marca_A,2016-06-10,2016,6,10,Friday
1040,4,"Mustang GT Performance Pack, is better than Camaro After coming from a basic, 2013 Camaro v6 manual. My Mustang is so much better in so many ways, I can actually see out of the Mustang! I have the base gt with performance pack, so comparing the performance of the two cars isn't really fair. Although comfort, interior quality, and technology is much better! I also find the 6 speed manual on the gt to be very smooth shifting. The only negatives I have found with the car, is that the exterior panel alignment could be better, gas mileage is sub par, but hey it is a v8! Also the back seat is not very comfortable to anyone over 5'1 due to the fastback design. I love what the base gt comes with although my word of advice if you are not going to upgrade the sound system, is to go ahead and step up the shaker system. The base 6 speaker audio is severely lacking. In fact it is dissapionting for a $32,000 car to have such a crappy system! There is no bass response and if you turn the radio up to 20 the music will sound like a muddy mess! Although I have never kept factory audio systems long, I find this one to be the worst system I have experienced, but I am currently in the process of upgrading it. Overall I love the car! It's is a beautiful body style, and drives amazing! It is very confident in corners, and the 6 speed manual is a thrill the throws are crisp. Clutch pedal travel is a little long, but it doesn't fatigue you in traffic. In my book this car gets a solid 4.5 stars!!",2016,Marca_A,2016-06-04,2016,6,4,Saturday

The Bluetooth has been a pain but it works.  It would be nice if the delivery of the vehicle included a checklist of features on the vehicle...there seems go be a lot of confusion as to what we do and don't have installed.

Mustang is just perfect interior. The performer is just like any other luxury car and is made in USA. I really recommend For Mustang. No bad price for everything the car has. For V6 got enough power like sport car and the technology is the ultimate in cars. The only thing is the comfort of the seat, I take much getting used for the front seat and rear seat way too small and less space.

1044,5,"Great car - caution about the Performance Pack The PP sets the car up for the racetrack. Yes, you get the Brembo brakes which are astonishing - but the ride quality is jittery, bumpy and nervous with steering that wants to follow every road imperfection. Felt like driving a car with very little suspension. In other words, exactly what you want in a track car but hard to enjoy day to day. Power is astonishing when driven right, keeping in mind that this engine is not a torque monster off the low end, but it has eye popping mid-range and high rev power. The sound when revving is scary good. I had the 3.73 rear end, and never could shift into 2nd and floor it without the car getting sideways.I tried but I could not live with The Beast on a daily basis as a commuter. We live in the country where the roads are pot-holed and not so smooth and that amplified the very firm ride. Because it was so uncomfortable as a daily commuter (45 miles each way), I had to trade mine back in within two weeks. BTW, I am used to sporty cars, having driven a VW GTI for 15 years. Also, being 6' 3"" it was hard to get in and out of the car, and I never really found a comfortable seat position. Miss the a/c cooled seats.On the plus side - the power is addicting but be ready for 18 mpg overall if you use it often. If you take it easy, 26 is possible. The manual shifter is excellent. I really loved / feared the car - but I can't live with it. To be honest, I wish I had kept it and replaced the springs with some from a regular GT. Hard to convince the wife to let me try one again, hahaha.",2016,Marca_A,2016-05-16,2016,5,16,Monday

1046,4,"Great muscle car for the price....! I had a 2010 Mustang GT I bought new, and was ready for a new car. Looked seriously at the highly rated Camaro SS, and also considered the Challenger RT. Really was in the mood for a change, instead of another Mustang GT. That said, found a great deal on a new 16 bright red GT, paying almost $9,000 less than I would have paid for the base Camaro SS. I know the SS is rated a little higher, is a little faster, etc, but for the price I paid, I am very pleased with the new GT. It has changed significantly from the 2010 model I traded in.... handles better, is quicker, looks cool, is much more planted on the road, and gets better gas mileage, even after adding 100 plus additional hp. For the price, I am very happy with the car. It's fun, looks great, drives great, and is way faster than I need to go!",2016,Marca_A,2016-05-11,2016,5,11,Wednesday

1050,5,I love this car I bought the 2016 Mustang Premium GT and am super happy.  This car has all the bells and whistles.  Car feels like a dream driving down the road.  Has all the power I would ever need.  I live in the city so I got the automatic due to the stop and go traffic of course.  Extremely smooth transmission.  Has Sync 3 which is really great.  Navigation works flawless along with the Bluetooth and I love being able to tell the car what temp I want and it sets it.  The interior looks wonderful from the leather seats to the classy gauges on the dash.  Car holds the roads really well around curves and back roads.  Many options to choose from such as steering handling and modes for the engine and tranny.  I keep mine in normal mostly to preserve gas.  I'm getting roughly 18 MPG.  I think that's pretty good in the city.  Anyway again I love this car and look forward to driving it each day.  My first Ford car and have been totally blown away.   Update:   I still love the car.  I have had a couple issues but nothing severe yet.  I noticed that the projection side mirror light's image of the mustang isn't clear anymore.  Not a big deal but haven't even owned the car a year and already an issue.  One day I was getting out of the car and the electric side mirror started moving on its own.  Was all messed up moving too far to one side and making an awful noise like was about to break off.  I opened the door back up to get into the car again and it stopped.

Two months into ownership Ford has taken the position the paint is not covered and has rejected the dealer's warranty repair plan.  This vehicle has only 400 miles on it and Ford is playing this game.Needless to say, having purchased approximately 18 new vehicles in the past 20 years, Ford can now forget about getting any more business from me and my family.  I would encourage anybody purchasing a new car, go with any OEM other than Ford!!Update... Ford Motor Co. never did change their position on this issue.  Apparently the primary problem was the selling dealership didn't report the problem to Ford within the 10-day window required for a brand new vehicle, so the burden was shifted away from Ford and onto the dealership or me.  In the end, the dealership applied the SurfaceCare product, which provides a 7-year warranty on the paint, at no cost to me to resolve the dispute.

1063,5,"FAST Ecoboost Pony I have the new 2016 Ford Ecoboost Mustang with the premium and pony package.  This car was love at first sight.  There are so many things that Ford added as little eye catchers that make it very appealing.  The new Ecoboost engine is very quick off the line and with 310 HP and 320 FTLBS of torque it is competitive with most muscle cars with bigger engines.  The Sync 3 with voice navigation is excellent, it will read me my incoming text messages from my iPhone 6.  I am 6'2"" and I fit well in the drivers seat but there are times that my foot will catch the door while getting in or out.  The rear seat isn't for the tall folks on long drives.  There is a cutout design in the headliner and seat backs that accommodate a few more inches of room but anyone over 5'9"" will have the head hitting the top.  The traction control modes are excellent.  I live where we get snow and the snow/wet pavement mode gives you the feeling of comfort, the tires with the pony package also help with this feature.  I have less than 1,000 miles on it and driving around town the gas mileage is awesome.  The different dash instrumentation layout options with color is a neat feature.  I would buy another tomorrow if given the option.  The only issue or challenge I had before buying was the stock exhaust sound.  No worries there, there are so many aftermarket exhaust options that I am sure I will get the sound I like.  Additionally, the mods for this car you can see on youtube and ecoboost models are already hitting the 500HP mark... awesome car, turns a lot of heads, and very fun to drive.",2016,Marca_A,2015-12-28,2015,12,28,Monday

1066,5,"2016 Mustang GT Premium – The Pony Car that Could! As an avid motorist, I've owned many vehicles in my lifetime. From pickup trucks to sports cars, from economy cars to luxury imports. The past three vehicles I've owned have all been Fords, as they're nearly unbreakable and they're every bit as good and better than many imports costing much more money. There's the prestige that comes from owning a high-end, imported luxury automobile from the likes of Audi, BMW, Lexus, Infiniti and others, but the novelty wears off and in the end, they're just cars that are expensive to own and maintain. Some handle, corner and drive very nicely, and the interiors of such brands as Audi are hard to beat (I've owned several Audi's, and I can attest to the interior design and quality). My most recent purchase, a 2016 Ford Mustang GT Premium with the 6 speed manual, Sync 3, Kicker Audio, California Special Package with BLIS and very comfortable heated and cooled leather seats with Miko Suede insets is one of my favorite automobile purchases ever. I considered holding out for the 2016 Chevy Camaro SS, but they're selling at full MSRP and the interior comfort, visibility and usefulness doesn't compare to Ford's Pony Car. Yes, I admit that I love the 2016 Camaro, and wouldn't hesitate to purchase one (I owned a 4th gen Z28 in the past and it was a great car). If the reported 1/2 second faster from 0 - 60 mph is your most important consideration, the Camaro SS is an awesome car. But, at nearly $4,000 more than a comparably equipped and loaded Mustang GT Premium, it's almost a no-brainer. I can use half of the $4,000 I saved and install Ford Performance parts to the 'Stang and it will outperform the Camaro SS in every respect.The new Sync 3 audio/infotainment system is much easier to use than the previous My Ford Touch, and should alleviate any hesitation that buyers may have concerning the My Ford Touch system, though I've had the Sony system with My Ford Touch in my previous Ford products and it was very simple to use. I could never figure out why it was difficult for some people to use, as there were redundant knobs and switches you could utilize if the voice or touch commands were too difficult to live with. It was much easier to use than an Android smartphone, and I haven't heard the reviewers complain about them.As for performance, my Mustang GT is a blast to drive. You can drive it like a ""commuter car"" and it does a fine job, or put your right foot on the accelerator and it will more than satisfy your appetite for a thrill ride. It's also remarkably economical if you drive it with economy in mind. I'm already seeing 24mpg highway in the real-world, and the time honored 5.0 engine hasn't even completed it's break-in period. As for the the sound of said engine - let's just say Ford really dialed it in perfectly. It's got that unmistakable 5.0 Liter Mustang sound, which is to say it sounds incredible! A true muscle-car sound that's long been a favorite in the Pony Car world.The fit and finish are also right up there with the best of the best, though I could stand for a little less faux stitching on the padded dash components, and some of the plastic bits are like most cars in this price range, but not obtrusive. The only small gripe I have is the lack of height-adjustable seat belts. Though they suit my 5'11"" body frame pretty well, it would be nice to have the option to adjust them for height.To sum it up, I think this may be one of those cars that I will keep for a long time. For me, a long time is typically three - four years, but I could see myself keeping this car much longer, and adding to it, as there are a gazillion accessories from Ford's parts bin, as well as many quality aftermarket manufacturers. Perhaps I'll keep it and add an Explorer or even Escape to the mix.

The car is awesome. The interior is made of high quality parts and materials. The previous years Mustangs did not have this kind of quality in the interior. This is why I never bought a prior generation Mustang. The car is a joy to drive. I was back and forth on the question of automatic vs. manual transmission and I opted for the automatic. Now days I believe there is more emphasis on quality automatics than manuals. I just don't want to deal with clutches in the future.

1069,5,"2016 V6 CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG 305 HP!! This review is for an ex-Hertz rental 2016 3.7 V-6 Mustang AUTOMATIC convertible purchased with 48,6XX miles.  Car had a few dings and one fairly serious scratch, so we got a great deal.Excellent car overall so far, and running great as of 51,000 miles. Practical folks will be glad to hear the steering, braking, visibility, and reliability are all excellent.  There is a sweet camera for backing up.Insurance costs on this car are very reasonable.The iron-sleeved aluminum engine block makes for better balance and more nimble handling compared to the much heavier cast iron V8 in the GT.Interior electronics and controls are all visible, logical, efficient to use, and attractive to look at. Cloth seats are sculpted nicely with nice bolsters for lateral support.  The cloth seats in the base convertible do not burn your butt on a hot day even though they are black.Climate controls are simple and functional.The convertible top is a vast improvement over previous models, especially for ladies.  To unlock the top, there's a big, easy-to-grab D-handle right above the rearview mirror that you pull down and twist one 1/4 turn.  Then you press a button until the top is back.  That's it!For the fun-loving folks, acceleration from 0-60 is 5.3 seconds (this car is quicker than a '99 SVT Cobra Coupe).The speedometer says ""GROUNDSPEED"", as if there is some other sort of speed we might be measuring.  A little hokey, perhaps. I love, love, love the glowing LED taillights.  Period.  Whoever came up with those....you rock.  2015-2016 taillight styling is already a huge improvement over the 2010-2014 models, and the sequential turn signals are just a bases loaded home run.///CONS///1)  GARAGE DOOR OPENER:  NONE!   Could use an integrated garage door (Homelink) button on the rearview mirror.  Our Jaguar XK8 convertible had Homelink buttons in the mirror, which they simply disabled when the ignition was off, to protect your garage contents.  That's a great way to design it, imho. 2)  KEY FOB:  The key fob is kinda big.  (Yes, I get that there’s an Emergency key inside of it.)3)  COLOR SCHEME:  Not crazy about the black interior in most of the base models.  Base model convertibles tend to have the black interior and a black top. Would have liked some sort of lighter camel or gray color on both, but we bought our car used.  4)  CABIN FILTER:  There is no good reason to make a cabin filter so hard to change.  This stupid design has one strange screw holding it together.  To make it worse, it is at an angle that makes it hard to see what tool you need.  Thank God for the iPhone camera to let me see into tight places, and the internet to confirm what I see.  Turns out, it is a T20 TORX head screw.  WHY would they do this?  To create simple work for unskilled dealer technicians, that's why.    I have a Torx toolset, but I still find this design completely ridiculous and unnecessary.  This could have been assembled with a single plastic snap strap like my Hyundai.  Ford added complexity for no added value.  That kind of engineering is OFFENSIVE to me and they are just ripping off their consumer. ///SUMMARY///OVERALL:  There is a tremendous value here for the money.  The Mustang has been improved over previous years I shopped for in nearly every possible way.Nearly every amenity you could think of, good looks from every angle (top up or top down), and great performance.

1074,5,Love my Mustang convertible! I have the eco-boost four cylinder turbo mustang convertible in magnetic. The car is extremely comfortable and has excellent technology with the *NSYNC navigation and especially the Bose shaker system!  The car is incredibly fast and when I go on long trips I'm getting 31 miles per gallon! It corners amazingly well and I'm 6 foot five and have plenty of room even be even being a pretty big guy. I decided not to have the spoiler on the back and as a result it looks very executive and has line similar to the old Mustang combined I guess with a Jaguar.  I know a lot of the purists believe only in the V8 but trust me when you put the pedal to the metal on this thing and it goes from 40 to 80 in seconds!,2016,Marca_A,2017-08-29,2017,8,29,Tuesday

You'd think they would put premium sound in such a nice car - I spent an additional $1000 to add a subwoofer and to upgrade the stock speakers and amplifier.

1077,4,"Another Mustang The #1 thing I can say about buying a car like this is investigate its history and do not depend on the dealer to tell you the truth or do their required checks to certify it as a Ford Certified Per Owned vehicle.  In the first 6 months we owned this car, it spent 3 of those months in the Ford dealers shop.  One stay was 33 days, one was 23 days and a couple more brief ones.  Long story short is that this Mustang had been owned by a rental car company and that was never disclosed to me by the Ford dealer.  Had it been, I would never considered purchasing it at any price.  The transmission in this car was opened and several parts replaced that were screwing up the shifting.  Pure abuse.  The drive line, rear axle, differential and other things were replaced.  Pure abuse.  After 8 months of this my wife and I went to the dealer in an attempt to replace the Mustang.  Perfect credit.  Great purchasing ability.  What they allowed me as a trade in on this car was insulting.  I argued for two days trying to get the dealer to right the wrong but no.  We did buy a brand new 2017 Mustang eco boost convertible.  Love the car and will never purchase pre owned again!  Also, don't think that you can appeal to Ford customer service to help you.  They can not.  These things are strictly up to the dealer!",2016,Marca_A,2017-05-07,2017,5,7,Sunday

1079,4,"Love my GT even more daily This is my first Mustang ever as well as my first convertible.  I never had a family member to own one or a close friend.  I had ""friends"" in high school that did, but never rode in one.  I rented this vehicle in August of this year and loved it from the start.  The feeling of being in a convertible is like no other driving experience I have ever had.  I also had never driven a V8 before either.  It was a pure endorphin/adrenaline rush. During my car research I looked also looked at the Camaro 2SS, while it was truly a great car it was just too expensive.  Another deciding factor in choosing the Mustang was that I had watched ""A Faster Horse"" on Netflix.  For those who haven't watched the documentary it is a great film on how they designed and made the new 2015 model as well as how the original come to be.  I just felt more of a connection to the Mustang and honestly Chevy had burned me before on a 98 Malibu I bought new.  Biggest piece of crap I have ever owned.  So it was an uphill battle for them anyway.  So the car itself....biggest pro to me is the look of the car.  I just stare at it in my garage and when I walk up to it at the grocery store.  It is a race red black top GT and it is gorgeous in my opinion.  Some folks don't like the new design, but I would not have considered this car without the new design.  The other biggest pro is the power.  Why you would buy an Ecoboost or a V6 in a Mustang is beyond me.  Yes the gas mileage sucks, but man that car rumbles and has sooooo much character that you just don't get in the other smaller engines.  It makes me smile every time I push the start button.  Finally, the other pluses is all the technology in the car.  This thing has got it all....I won't list them here as you can check it out yourself, but a hidden gem I found is that you can program your key so that the car wont go over a certain speed and the radio wont go over a certain level.  It also tracks the miles put on the car with that key.  So if I want my son, who is 16 and gets giddy every time I let him drive it (Im in the car with him), to drive it without me at least it is the realm of a discussion to be considered.  The biggest downside to this car is the ride.  It is bumpy and I mean BUMPY.  You feel every divot in the road.  I know this isn't a luxury car....I got that and I wasn't expecting a BMW cloud feeling, but for the first time ever I got slightly car sick after a 5 hour drive to see my family for the holidays.  We had to stop so I could get rid of the motion headache I had.  So, that is a big bummer.  I feel that if they could have made the ""Normal"" mode just a bit smoother on the suspension that they would have a perfect car.  Now I own it and I am sure I will get used to it.  It does not diminish how I feel about the car overall.  I love driving it around town, but wont be taking it on any long trips without at least a half a Bonine in my system.  I do look forward to taking it to the beach...I mean.....it's a convertible...that is a requirement. The gas mileage is what you would expect from a V8....not very good.  However, I was getting 27mpg on the interstate with cruise control on, but city is 18 to 19.  A few other things to note before I close is that the feel of the steering wheel is great and adjustable with the steering mode.  I keep it on Comfortable while driving around town, but kick it back to sport when I want to push it.  The SYNC system is great, but I am still fighting the voice command a bit as she doesn't always understand me.  A bit more work could go into that aspect of the software.  The biggest thing here is that the car is just fun to drive.  I didn't go for practical, I went for fun and if you want a fun car.... get the Mustang GT, and if you are feeling really spirited...make it a convertible.",2016,Marca_A,2016-12-06,2016,12,6,Tuesday

1082,4,Great car horrible engine I've had this car as a rental for 8 days. The ride is very smooth and supple. There is some cowl shake at times but it's mostly well controlled. With the top up road noise is muted from the tires but noise comes through the windows easily.  The ecoboost 4 cylinder is no where near 5.9-6.1 in the convertible. Best time I got was 6.9   It lacks any authority in acceleration and is a very poor choice. The fuel ole age I got was 19.3 mpg   My 5.7 Hemi manual challenger gets that. The seats are quite good as I have three bad discs and spinal stenosis and arthritis in my sacrum and these seats were a dream. The stereo system leaves a lot to be desired. My Boston acoustics in my challenger easily outperforms the shaker system. I rented this car to see if I want to buy it. I do but not this powertrain.

1093,1,"DO NOT BUY A 2015-17 FORD MUSTANG If I could give Ford Motor Company a BIG 0, I would. I bought my 2015 Mustang used in 2016 with approximately 13000 miles. Loved the car at first. Impressive for a Ford. I live in Florida and it is warm year round in most parts of the State. However, I barely use the AC, I prefer the windows down unless it is scorching heat and humidity. Five months into ownership at approximately 20000 miles the AC stopped working and I took it to a Ford dealer. It was covered under the 3yr/36000 BTB warranty. The problem was the Evaporator. The repair took several days as it required the techs to remove the entire dashboard to remove and replace the Evaporator. I thought it was poor location design if the part would fail with such low mileage or time. However, I also thought that this was an isolated issue and at 20000 miles it was now fixed. Fast forward 15 months and 20000 additional miles, go figure the AC stopped working again. The 12 month 12000 mile warranty on parts and labor is now expired and the 3yr/36000 is no longer applicable. I took the car to another Ford stealership, and the problem was diagnosed as the Evaporator again. The cost to repair it is $2400, $600 parts, remaining labor. Outrageous, the same part twice within 40000 miles. This would not be such an issue if the part was easily accessible and low cost. I called Ford Corporate, they assigned a case number and communicated with the stealership. End result = end user must pay for Ford's defective part. DO NOT BUY A 2015-17 FORD MUSTANG. Do your research, not an isolated incident. Unless you plan on paying $2400 every 20000 miles or 15 months for a reoccurring problem that Ford knows about. I did not have the repairs done at the stealership. They emailed me for feedback, albeit automated, so here it is: This was my first and last Ford. They have lived up to their reputation. FORD = For Order Repair Daily. Found On the Road Dead. Isn't a pity because the car drives nicely and I thought Ford's reliability and quality was increasing.

1096,5,"My First Mustang and I'm Keeping It!!! I never thought I would own a Ford Mustang after my experience of going out to purchase one when they first changed the body style to  the ""throwback"" look. I loved the look of the car, but after going to two dealerships and watching both salesmen, one having to run back to the office to get jumper cables, and the 2nd salesman, at a completely different dealership, actually carried the jumper cables around with him. I thought to myself, as a single female, in a large city, there is no way ever, am I going to have to worry about, ""is my car going to start today."" Enough much more important things, I wasn't going to deal with ""that"" for a car.  Well, after my BMW Z4 convertible got totaled in the hailstorm, I was actually given a 2016 Mustang as my rental. It was in love. It's absolutely gorgeous inside and out. If you can find the ceramic interior, oh my gosh..absolutely gorgeous. The black interior is beautiful too, in fact that's what I have in mine right now. I love it. This car let me tell you is in the same class as Chevrolet's corvette. It drives so smooth, it has quite a few driving modes from normal, to comfort, sport+, to track and even snow/rain. Steering too. You can adjust your ride however you want. It has ambient lighting inside, which I believe has 8 different color choices. You can change the gauges and lighting in the car to different colors. It has the Mustang logo light that comes from the mirror when you open your door in the dark on both passenger and driver side. The trunk space is unbelievable. The back bucket seats, that's right bucket seats in the back, also fold down to give you even more room in the trunk. I have the big screen in my car which is incredible. It makes it so easy to see when you are backing up with the rear view camera. It has climate controlled seats which was a HUGE selling point being in TX, I can actually cool my seats down before I get in it. It has the remote start and key-less ignition to make this all possible. It has so many features on it, it's crazy. It has dual a/c, you can preset the car to save your a/c settings on both sides. You can even turn off the passenger side if you so desire. It does have heated seats too which will be great for winter, or if you have a sore back, it's wonderful when you are sitting in traffic. Now, mine does not have the blind spot feature, but I did drive one that did, and it works great. Since mine does not have the navigation, (you can order a subscription to SYNC with Ford for $60 plus tax for the year which is refundable btw), I did order the SYNC subscription but was disappointed in the fact that it only showed the street names of where to turn on the screen, not an actual map. It did have sound, but just not the greatest thing by any means, so I cancelled it, and bought a Garmin with a cross over lane alert, which is very similar to the blind spot  option. I think my favorite thing about the car, besides the color, the features, the wi-fi, voice activated controls, ambient lighting, cool and heated seats, remote start, keyless entry, unbelievable smooth ride, roomy trunk space which expands, the gorgeous lightening blue color, leather bucket seats front and back, console and glove compartment, blue tooth, would be my SHAKER radio system and my 20 in Premium chrome wheels. The wheels change the whole look of the car. I could have purchased a black one, 2016 instead of 2015, but one the seats were orangish...terracotta??, doesn't matter, they would have had to be redone, but the wheels were the standard wheels. They looked like two totally different cars when placed side by side. I stuck with the 2015, even though all of the features were exactly the same with the exception of the blind spot alert, seats I couldn't live with but could have changed with the money I would have saved, but the smaller tires and wheels without the chrome, just made it look so small, next to my muscle car. LOL. I highly recommend this car. There are no blind spots, great visibility, great features, rides like a dream, great customer service, it's just a great car. It's my first Ford ever. I can't believe the improvements in the brand over the last 20 years. They have really come a long way. So it's definitely going to be my car for a very long time. I just love it.

I test drove two other trucks before I showed this to my husband. He knew I was in love with it before I showed it to him. I love this truck. It drives like a 1/2 ton but has the power of a 3/4 ton. With the 6.0 engine and the 410 rear end I can pull my 16 foot stock trailer with all four horses in it like it's not even back there. When we go get hay. I can drive the trailer right out to the hay field and load it with 70-80 bales and get home with no problem. Ny husbands 4X4 Chevy 1/2 ton can't carry that much.

Have driven friends and relatives C3, C4, C5 Vettes but the C6 is of course the best to date. The positives: Awesome power and acceleration, great exterior styling. The negatives: poor build quality and realiability. Hard to get in and out of even at my age. Road noise premeates the cabin. Been to the dealer twice in four weeks of ownership; wipers stopped working/a wire got cut by the wiper assembly itself, popping sound from the rear. Both issues were fixed by the dealer.

The design, power, and handling are phenomenal.  There is so little to find fault with!  The acceleration is addictive.  The carbon ceramic brakes are powerful and clean!  The targa top is a welcomed feature, as is the front-parking camera.  Chevrolet knocked it out of the park with the 2017 Z06.",2017,Marca_B,2018-02-04,2018,2,4,Sunday
1597,5,"Outstanding machine For the past six months I have owned my first Corvette, and I have to admit I was a bit hesitant at first about purchasing one but boy was I wrong.  Even though it is American made, the quality of the car is top notch and it feels very well built.  So far I have found almost zero things to complain about with this vehicle.  The stock exhaust note is great because its isn't insanely loud but it is definitely loud enough and the acceleration is mind boggling. I have yet to come even close to pushing this car to the limit and in all honesty I don't think I ever will.  Its surprisingly comfortable as well and if you put it into touring mode the suspension becomes very soft and supple which is something I never would have expected. If there is one thing that I can complain about, it would have to be the traction that seems almost impossible to get any time you hit the gas peddle even a little bit.  It isn't necessarily touchy but you have to be very cautious and aware that the backend will get loose very quickly. Another thing that I love about my z06 is the exterior styling.  The car is very sexy and sleek and if it weren't for the Corvette badge on the front, I could easily mistake it for a Ferrari. Overall I am head over heels in love with my z06 and would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market looking for supercar performance at an unbeatable price.",2017,Marca_B,2018-03-25,2018,3,25,Sunday

1599,5,Bat Mobile I had the 2016 Corvette Z-51 first and I purchased this one exactly one year later. This one is so much more power. The regular is probably all the power anyone could ever use on the street. This regular corvette would make a very good everyday driver. The second with all that power you would just be looking at way to much expense in tires. The tires are only good for about 15k miles. If you want the ultimate affordable car the Z06 is it. The speed it can achieve so quickly is crazy. The shear thrill and smile on your face is second to none! I have the A8 transmission and no one needs a 7 speed manual in this car. It is impossible to shift that fast. The automatic is faster 0-60mph by a few 10th's.,2017,Marca_B,2018-01-18,2018,1,18,Thursday

1601,4,"An eight-month love affair... I've had my white Grand Sport convertible with 8-speed auto transmission for eight months now and I still absolutely love her.  I've put 9,300 miles on her; the first 2,000 a very careful break-in, then 7,000 miles of grand touring driving: from Austin, Texas to Key West, Florida and back by way of the southern Appalachian mountains, then a quick trip from Austin to Denver and back.  Plus some 'spirited' driving on the back roads around Austin.  You definitely will want a good radar + laser detector, plus Waze on your smart device if you drive this machine!  And after those eight months I am still head-over-heels in love with my baby (I named her ""Emoji"" because from the front the headlights and grill give her the look of one of those slanty-eyed happy face emoticons).  This car is, in my opinion, the sweet spot of the Corvette lineup, and the culmination of seven generations of engineering.  This is a supercar in everything but price.  For the  price of a Ferrari F12 you can buy FIVE Grand Sports and have enough left over to buy gas for all for a year each, probably, and yet lap times for each are pretty much identical (ok, in Car & Driver's Lightning Lap face-off the GS bests the F12 by several seconds around Virginia International Raceway).  This is a car that is at home on twisty backroads, the Autobahn, and the racetrack, and there are not that many production cars that can come close to the performance, gas mileage, and grand touring comfort - and possibly none for the price.  Very few cons, in my opinion: 1) Limited luggage capacity in the convertible, but much better in the coupe; 2) not a car for winter driving in snow/ice climates, as there are no winter/snow tires available; 3) visibility, especially on the rear quarters, could be better; 4) seats could use more lateral support for a car capable of 1.1 G lateral force when cornering on street tires (but they are miles ahead of previous generation Corvette seats, and actually do provide some lateral support!);  5) if you value privacy you will get tired of people complimenting you when stopped at traffic lights! :)  Other than that there's really very little that I find annoying about this wonderful machine.  Highly recommended, if you are  in the market for a two-seater touring/racing/sports car.  And I haven't even mentioned things like the dry-sump lubrication (keeps the engine oiled during hard cornering/accel/braking), magnetic shock absorbers (monitors road conditions and adjusts the ride 180 times a second for road/driving conditions), and phenomenal braking ability (70-0 in 136 feet on stock tires!), nor have I mentioned the vastly-improved cabin appointments, with heated/ventilated seats, passenger climate controls on the passenger vent, heads-up instrumentation, etc. etc.).  Oh, and this website does not seem to allow line breaks, so sorry for the one big run-on paragraph.  Respectfully, Delta Foxtrot, Austin, Texas.",2017,Marca_B,2017-06-09,2017,6,9,Friday

The manual has no tax and mileage is way up compared to the automatic. 3. If you did not purchase the aero package then you are going to have road rash on the leading front edges of the rear fenders very expensive to repair.2. Watch tire wear closely, tires have only 7/32 tread brand new and any alignment issues will present themselves within the first 2 or 3 thousand miles.In ref to my first review, at this point in time the least expensive way to go is with after market skirts. Bear in mind, this fix only applies to 2015 and 2016Zo6's. The GOOD NEW's is the 2017 Zo6's and GrandSports all come with the side skirts. Still the best bang for the buck. Fuel mileage has picked up a tickto 22mpg. Better but with the cylinder deactivation feature I still think it should be more.

Problems from day ONE STILL UNRESOLVED.  Air conditioner/climate control wildly hot to only cool - never ever cold.  Seat cooling works mildly just a few times in the two years we have had it.  First year a horribly loud vibration when going up a hill.  Selling dealer took it for joy rides and left the suspension at the hardest/racing setting.  The cabin cooling and seat cooling still unresolved.  Second dealer I went to is trying, but NO results.   This car has been in dealers shops perhaps two dozen times for up to three weeks at a time.  Gas mileage unbelievably wonderful.  Long Beach Red - be prepared for people to follow you to a parking lot to look closer and compliment appearance.  I've wanted a Corvette since I saw the very first one in 1953.  We're driving the car off the selling dealers lot and Priince's ""Give me a Red Corvette"" comes on XM - Bridge.  People follow us in the freeway in our blind spot just to look for miles then pass and wave.  Take all of the remarkably wonderful things about this car that we love, put it against the horrid reliablility and amount of time it's been in the shop - is it worth it?  Absolutely NOT.  This is by far the most disappointing motor vehicle I've had Ever and I've had 13 brand new ones.  For the first time in my life, I REGRET BUYING IT.........................................  Be prepared for all the crap you will have to learn to tolerate if you buy one.  Chevy complaints in the sky?  All they did was to tell me to go to other dealers to see if they could fix it.........

2076,3,"Be Cautious with a C7 The C7 is a fun car to drive but I must say my C6 had better visibility and more interior room.  The quality of my C7 was really marginal which lead to my decision to sell.  It was really frustrating that the cooled seats did not work, the start/stop button sometimes worked, sometimes it did not.  The windshield was such poor quality that when driving into the sun all I could see where the bubbles in the glass.   The memory seats only worked when they were in the mood.   The seats are now so small that my 5' 11"" 190lb body was always sitting on the bolsters vs actually sitting in the seat.  The list goes on and on.  Don't get my wrong, the car was fun to drive, lots of power and handles well.  It was all the things that did not work and the Chevy Dealer telling me not to bring the car back to him as he could not fix the problems with the car.  I expected more from a $70,000 car.

Mine switches back and forth when there is no change in accelerator position or load, as in going up hill or down hill.  The ""warble"" only lasts a second but it still is noticeable to me.  I equate it to the pinging you used to hear from engines running on low octane fuel and accelerating.  My car has never had anything in it but premium 93 octane fuel.

2081,5,"Selectable Economy for Your Power Smoke the tires, lay 100 ft. of rubber, run at 160 MPH or just cruise at 80 MPH at 31.1 MPG. This is not your father's Sports Car !!! Traction control works and is advisable normally but if you want to GO switch to Track mode and turn off traction control. Just keep in mind there is nothing reasonable to repair on this car. A clear on ramp will leave you going 100 MPH which is way faster than the traffic you are merging into so brakes if used sparingly are needed. By the way the brakes work great just remember this is a base model so expect pushing it will heat the brakes causing fade and reduced life. Just limit your play time and this car will give good service for a long time. Power is power so 455 HP will go to 650 HP with just addition of a $5000 supercharger but there are reasons why there is a $30000 difference between base and Z06. Thirty percent is GM greed but the other 70% is all need. So don't just jack up the horsepower and think you beat the curve.

2082,5,"Manual or Auto? I recently traded in my LT1 2015 with 8 speed auto for a 2016 with 7 speed manual.   I've always been a manual transmission guy with my sports cars and auto for the family sedans.  I bought the automatic believing the paddle shift would simulate the manual experience.  After almost two years of driving, I can say that the automatic doesn't deliver the classic sports car ""feel.""  The downshifting is where I mostly notice the difference.  The manual transmission Vette is a very different experience.  I now feel that I'm really driving the manual Vette, not just putting the car in Drive and aiming it.  I do mostly around town driving, so rarely get the car out of fourth gear, so constant shifting is not a hassle.  The transmission shifts smoothly once I got used to the stiff clutch and found the correct shift points.  So, if  you're shopping for a Vette, my advice is to try both transmissions before you buy.FOLLOW UP:  Sprang for a 911 since this review.  MSRP exactly double the Vette's.  And, it is auto--the well engineered ""PDK"" system by Porsche.  This is much closer to a manual than the Vette's, plus the Porsche quality vs Chevrolet build.  However, for the money, the Vette is an outstanding value,  You won't lose much when it is time to sell a C7 unless you got one loaded with overpriced bells and whistles. Example :  Color matching brake calipers for $600.  Get real.  But the option prices on the 911 are even worse.",2016,Marca_B,2016-08-27,2016,8,27,Saturday

Car as $17G in options but wanted the Shark Grary Metallic exterior w/Kalahari interior. Black stinger stripe, mirrors and spoiler with transparent top w/red calipers.  Absolutely gorgeous. Quieter than my GS convertible and beautiful interior design and function. The nav. system greatly improved and got 19.5 mpg on my 450 mile trip home from dealer.

We to it on a 3,000 mile road trip to Key West Florida and it performed extremely well and we got 30 mpg at times and kept it in touring mode all of the time. It is quite comfortable and I love the power it has - especially getting on the highway in the accelerator lane or passing another car with the exhaust opened. We had  burlwood installed on the dash, center console, steering wheel and door control accents which, with the Kalahari interior, makes for a luxurious interior and won Best Interior Award over 350 vettes at the 2017 Corvette Show in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Also won in Columbia & Osage Beach, Missouri Shows.

2093,5,"A terrific car, but not perfect: UPDATE 4 Now 28 months and 23,000 miles into a Z51 in Long Beach Red:  Still a tremendous value and top-shelf sports car, a view from someone who has raced cars on the amateur level. It's not so much that acceleration, handling, braking, and feel are superb; it's that you feel attached to the car. The styling remains beautiful.  The interior is very comfortable.  Apple CarPlay still works poorly, though a bit better with iOS 11.3; (1) Apple Maps works slowly so that you sometimes miss a turn, and Maps itself has poor directions and out-of-date Tom Tom data (no Google Maps except aurally); (2) Apple Music plays with adequate reliability only.  In addition to the electronics, the other problem has been the shifting, which professional journalists complained about and I found true also. Over time, shifting has become more fluid, although there is still an occasional glitch in the high gears. Whether I have adjusted to the Corvette idiosyncrasies, or the gearbox has loosened, the shifting has improved.You can pack quite a lot under the hatch -- at least four suitcases.And, oh, if your state requires a front license plate, my experience has been this:  The Chevrolet-supplied holder, even when mounted by a qualified Chevrolet technician, will scratch the front bumper and no Chevrolet dealer, out of the three that I have tried, will take responsibility for the problem.

The instrumentation and head-up display are keen. The GPS could be better, with cheaper updates.

2112,4,"Present Imperfect The 2015 Corvette StingRay is a helluva buy, but it has too many flaws and compromises to be a ""great"" all around sports/touring car.        First, the good parts:  Although a few friends call it the ""cartoon car"" the C7's styling is gorgeous.  It will turn heads and get ""thumbs up"" from passers-by.  Some  ""Corvette guys"" do not like the rear end because it lacks the traditional round taillights. This is merely a matter of taste. Overall, the exterior design is a winner even if it does create a bunch of nooks and crannies to clean. The engine also does not disappoint. The StingRay has gobs of muscle and a wonderful Made in USA V-8 sound that will put a smile on your face. The car is built low to the ground. It can be difficult for older folks to enter/exit and the long nose makes for visibility challenges in parking lots with concrete barriers.  The rear hatch has a troublesome latch assembly which needs to be slammed shut rather than merely closed and the automatic hatch opening switch on the dash is positioned too close to the driver's door; I have opened the hatch with my knee a dozen times slipping into the driver's seat.       Those who live in a four season climate need to consider whether they want the ""summer only"" 20 inch rear tires. I have no idea whether these are really unmanageable below 40 degrees as the warnings state. My choice was the Michelin year round set up. Whatever, this is not a snow car, at least not with me behind the wheel.       Where the StingRay disappoints most is inside.  Here  the layout is good and  straightforward but the materials used are just so-so, closer to WalMart than Brooks Brothers. No matter what color interior you choose, it will be mostly black. It is unlikely your salesman will tell you that on a sunny summer day the amount of glass in this car makes the cockpit uncomfortably hot (even with the A.C. cranked up full bore)  unless you are willing to take out the roof panel or buy an after-market insert.   BTW, the insert does fix the problem and one wonders why GM doesn't simply include it as an option.      The seat belt guides are poorly positioned and I have given up on trying to keep mine in the intended (dime store quality) track.  Similarly, the seat release is placed quite low and would be more user-friendly if it were higher on the seat back. The basic seats in the LT1 version are borderline with only minimal adjustments possible.  Lack of bolstering is an increasing issue for me.  Why GM skimped on standard heating  - something that comes on Japanese cars costing half as much - and position memory is a mystery.      The Navigation system is a real P.O.S.  It is very slow in taking input and recently in driving through a strange city at night, the spoken directions lagged reality by a block or more.  Overall it is a disgrace to General Motors.  Twice now , the touch screen has gone blank for half a day and then suddenly reappeared.  Nor am I a fan of the other techno stuff, but maybe that is just age talking. I refuse to accept the facile explanation, ""well, what do you expect, its a Chevy.""  I believe Detroit can design and the UAW can build an automobile just as well as Klaus and Helmut in Stuttgart. The idea that  ""they are trying to sell it to kids,""  is also a non-starter; how many kids can buy a $60,000+ two seat car?       Don't misunderstand, this is real good car FOR THE MONEY, but it could be so much better!  Which is why I am seriously thinking about a 911.",2015,Marca_B,2016-01-13,2016,1,13,Wednesday

Then I drove a 2015 C7 Z51 wih magnetic ride (shocks), NPP (exhaust), PDR (Performance Data Review) video, etc, etc options. As a retired 68 year old driver of 50+ cars (many of those sports cars), I fell in love with this car immediately. This is no ""garage queen"". I drive my Corvette. I had taken a sports car driving course in Florida several years ago, so I can and do drive spiritedly. I can appreciate what the C7 can do. I am taking another course soon at the Ron Fellows Corvette Stingray Owners course to learn even more about this beauty. The service support is wonderful. Get to know your Service Advisor. He will become your friend because most of them are true specialists and appreciate the Corvette's uniqueness. I get 21 mpg around town and 29+ mpg on the road.

My pet peeve with most American cars is the cheap materials used on the interiors. It's a little better than before, but there is still much room for improvement. On the value front, for the money spent I would have had to go back at least 2 years to buy a Porsche 911, which handles much better, has a much higher quality interior as well as fit and finish, and, imho, is just as beautiful.

My mileage is nearing 26,000 and I haven't needed the warranty yet.  A Z06 is only about 200lb heavier than a Porsche Boxter but has 140 more hp, is 250lb lighter than an M3 (but has 75 more hp) and 400lb lighter than a Viper, but just slightly less hp.

2181,5,"What a gift! My wife and I just received a gorgeous 2002 Pewter C5 ""Base"" with the AT as a gift from my father-in-law.  The past six years he drove it less than 2500 miles. I was never too sure about Corvettes in the past because the ones I had ridden in were older (pre-C5) and felt like a car without shocks.  Not this car.  The ride is so comfortable I could use it as a daily driver.  As it is, I am greatly enjoying this car.  There was about $2,500 worth of deferred maintenance, but with a clean bill of health and only 120K miles, this car is in remarkable condition.  Not a single ding in the body and the paint is flawless, which says a lot about how GM took care in the factory paint process.  The drivetrain is the most responsive of any vehicle I have ever owned, and the handling is very tight.  There are a few minor rattles (I would expect this for the age and mileage) and the driver's side window is frozen in the up position, so tomorrow I am taking it to a friend who has done a lot of work on GM vehicles.  Apparently the window problem is common with Vettes.  I am also doing a complete brake job all around, as I am told that rotors on Vettes aren't worth turning, so I have bought all-new parts.  Will see how challenging this process is.  The Bose sound system is very good, even by today's standards.  Be aware that a common problem with the driver's seat is that it is subject to the seam splitting in the door side corner closest to the seatback.  Will cost me about $100 to fix, not too bad.  Also, the plastic housing of the bottom seat cushion typically separates some over time from the seat bottom cushion.  It's not really repairable, and I am told that the sport seat holds up better.  As far as maintenance costs go, everything is more expensive than the typical passenger car.  Mention that it is a Corvette, and the parts cost is double.  But in comparison to other cars in this class, it is a great value.  Built-in cup holders are scarce - there is only one that I have found in the short time I have owned this car.  I plan on getting another ""portable"" one for the passenger.  So far all the electronics on this car are working flawlessly.  My car came without keyless entry fobs, so I was able to order two on e-bay for $25 for the pair, and it only took about 60 seconds to program them myself using the owner's manual.  This was a pleasant surprise considering that many cars require you to go to a dealer to get fobs programmed and can charge you a substantial (more that $50) amount for such a simple task.  As far as overall value, this car is a great surprise and the re-sale values are pretty good.  Low-mileage (less than 50K miles) go for over $20K, and some with the same mileage as mine and the same excellent condition and good Carfax are $15K to $20K.",2002,Marca_B,2016-07-21,2016,7,21,Thursday

I have the ""base"" 350 HP model but it still feels like it gets from zero to sixty in just under five seconds.  Always garaged, my car's light pewter color is still very good and it looks great with the dark tint of the side and rear windows. While the Z06/manual is the enthusiast's choice, the base LS1 with 4-speed AT is a superb daily driver that provides a ton of low-rev power. You always have what you need for the daily commuting challenge and it's a breeze on the highway. This model is now 15 years old and still gets 28-30 MPG on the highway (Summer time). I don't drive it during the Northern Winter, to avoid snow/ice and risk for frame rust. The interior is basic by today's standards but the leather wheel and seats hold up well, and look for the upgraded Bose entertainment system (which is still good by today's standards). Corvette seats have been the favorite joke of automotive writers but you need to decide for yourself. I've driven this car for 15 hours at a time with minimal stops, and have never had a sore back from the seats. I cannot say the same for a Porsche and its Recaro seats I owned in the past. The Corvette also bests its German rival with its reliability, especially for the power train and brakes. With its composite body and plastic interior pieces, it does have a few flex creaks (not rattles) with age, and I've needed to replace the weatherstripping. These are small issues when compared to how the 2002 Corvette cruises through each year with the same agility and power - with only oil changes and tire rotations needed. Overall, a great used super car bargain!  If you are in the market, I recommend you search for models which have always been in warmer climates. If you buy from a dealer, it's not difficult to negotiate covered shipment for your car, and look for aftermarket parts/service warranties from reputable providers (parts can be pricey).  I may be selling mine this Summer, so stay tuned. Enjoy!",2002,Marca_B,2016-02-23,2016,2,23,Tuesday
2184,4,"Should be faster I purchased a black 2002 auto transmission Corvette with 33,000 miles on it (I wanted a manual, but my left knee is too messed up).  I love the car, but it seems like she loses power after hard acceleration a few times in a row. Also, I think the voltage regulator is bad cause sometimes it drops down to 12.3 when I am driving and it also jumps up and down a lot when I step on the brakes. For the car having 350 HP it doesn't feel very fast to me except for when it is first started in the morning. Other than that issue, I totally love the car. I get compliments on it all the time.

Mechanically the car has been good but build quality needs improvement except for the paint job which is the best I have ever seen.  Problems we have had are: 1. Three headlight bulbs replaced. 2. Entire locking mechanism for power convertible top had to be replaced. 3. Coolant temperature switch replaced. 4. Four trunk pistons failed with the fifth now broken. 5. Seat belt retainer bezel broken off and replaced.  Fuel mileage is average that is 25 around town - less if air running and about 30 mpg at 65 mph if air not running.  Trunk space is inadequate and simple repair under the hood is difficult and expensive.,2007,Marca_C,2010-07-07,2010,7,7,Wednesday

Very quiet with top up at high speeds (much less wind noise than the Sebring).  Heated seats (with five settings) are great!  Gas mileage is poor (24 mpg) for a small car with a clutch with weak acceleration.  Nice, solid build quality, pretty looking, but it is a chick car.

I like speed, but not Grand Prix MPH. I want comfort, but not so much that I do not know what to do with it. I love my new Beetle. It is roomier than my former BMW 325i. The trunk is bigger, but configured differently. It runs a little rougher than my old BMW, but we are talking a $20,000 car vs. a $40,000 car. You get what you pay for. The ease of driving and engineering of devices is so easy. BMW and Benz take brain power to figure it all out. VW is simple and, well, simple. The Beetle is comfy, fun, and costs much less money.

Immediately, my transmission died completely. My warranty company gave me a $4,000 check and voided my warranty after seeing the $12,000 repair bill. Then, the battery died. Twice. As did the alternator and air conditioning. My rear window also got stuck and that would have cost me 4 hours of labor fees just to get to the broken bits. It's not like I drove it a lot - over a course of 3 years I didn't even drive 10,000 miles. For the love of god, stay away from this car. It is one problem after another, literally every 3-5 months.Update:It has been two years since I got my new car. I have named it ""Not Beetle,"" and have had zero problems with it.

I can count on my hand how many times this car has been to the dealer for unscheduled service. First 100 miles the waterpump failed and was replaced without any hassles. Second time was due to the city of Chicago not posting any hazard warning for street work, destroying the bottom oil pan at 40,000 miles.

The car is comfortable and has been dependable to date other than the repeated replacement of headlights (three in 65,000 miles).  The interior has held up well despite the miles and three kids.

It generally gets good gas mileage but there is a problem.  Our diesel fuel isn't all that good and the engine has a tendency to combine some of the bad components with carbon particles which, over time, ends up clogging the intake manifold.  There has been a solution (a rather expensive one) but VW no longer supports it.  You can get to about 30,000 - 40,000 miles before something has to be done.  Know this going in, if VW figures out a solution to this problem, the car is a great buy, if they don't stay away.  ",2003,Marca_C,2006-01-24,2006,1,24,Tuesday

When I bought it at 151,000 miles, a few weeks later I noticed a lot white smoke coming out my tail pipe as I accelerate and it was chugging during that time. (Worse in winter). It faced a lot oil leaks and found out I had coolant leak too. I tried to get this oil leak under control after 3 repairs and still hasn't been fixed and spent slightly over $1,000 for that same oil problem. Oi! She was an oil eater! Until I finally got a tune up, that helped the chugging to stop, but then still got blue smoke coming out tail pipe. Not to mention, this is a turbo engine. My mechanic who specialize in European cars mentioned that turbo goes out every 75,000 miles. A turbo itself is $700 and labor? Probably $1,000. Eventhough, two Volkswagen dealerships told me I needed a new engine. Sitting in that driver bucket seat is uncomfortable. My lower back started to feel the burning and aching. The headlights are always loose, the rubber sealing doesn't reattach properly. The lightbulbs? They burn out frequently. My CD player skips or stops music for few seconds.

Replacing one of the front headlights was even worse. Now one of the front lenses has fallen off... The front left turn signal fell out of place from some clip that's broken. Now the check engine light is on - who knows how much THAT's going to cost. Performance is wretched, even for a 4 cyl. Mileage is only 25 mpg hwy.

2574,4,"GR8 Bug Convertible I hesitated to buy a new beetle for a two reasons - first because it was not Germany made. Then I learned that Honda's are from Ohio, so that was silly. Second, what would the resale value be (now who cares, I love it).  I have the Harvest Moon Beige with a Beige Top and Tan interior, in my opinion the most sophisticated looking.  One issue I have is keeping it showroom perfect. The first big wind in a parking lot allowed the door to hit a car parked next to it, not unusually hard, but enough to ding my door (the other car had no damage). This made me feel the metal/paint finish was inferior to other cars I have owned.  I may get a daily driver and try to keep it for weekend fun!",2009,Marca_C,2009-08-17,2009,8,17,Monday

However a few problems changed our mind of giving this car to a begining driver.  Changing Headlamp is very involved and not recommened for car owner. The procedure for this process is 8 pages long.  Ground clearance is so close to the ground that 3 inches of snow ripped front skid plate from the car. The skid plate is made from very thin plastic and is not much use. I also struck a small wooden object approx. 3 inches tall while moving less than 2 mph. while parking the car along side of the road. this knocked a hole in my transmition.,2009,Marca_C,2010-09-03,2010,9,3,Friday

The 2009 model is much improved with more power, heated seats and all. Edmunds reviewer here does NOT understand why VW lovers buy these, as he called it-stale design with small back seat.

The Beetle, her name is Phoebe, is totally for me. I can't wait to drive. It handles well in the rain, I fit a carseat with no problems in the back and my 19 month old has no problems getting out because of the way the seat lifts forward.

I purchased in Brandon FLorida, paid cash.  My car is now 12 years old, I always treated my car like my most treasured possession, my mileage is now 19,000 miles no dents, no scratches, beautiful leather gray interior.  At the age of 6 (car age) my interior dash, side panels, front and back and around my steering wheel started getting gummie and stickie.  Oh, by the way I am a female.  I took it to Myrtle Beach VW to show it to them, before I went I checked for any recall, none reported.  The VW Dealer in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, first question out of their mouths (talking to a male) he wanted to know what I used to clean the interior. I immediately became annoyed,and asked would you ask a man that as a first question?  I told them I carefully read the Manuel when I purchased the care and I knew what to clean the interior.  His claim was that I used something that created the problem.  Again I said would you have made that statement to a MAN????? They did not help me at all.  I then went to several body shops and found out that they have seen the same thing in other VW New Beetles 2005.  Called VW Executive offices and explained the situation to them, again to no avail.

I believe the weather in Wisconsin has a dramatic influence on how the windows operate.

VW of America's answer to us is, ""we are very sorry."" We feel we will have to get rid of the car before one of us loses an eye.  Our dealership has admitted to having several cars with similar problems, sometimes it is the passenger door. ",2005,Marca_C,2005-07-27,2005,7,27,Wednesday
2617,4,"A good value and fun! My second bug and not as sprightly as my '01 Turbo coupe.  It's a very heavy small car (3200 lbs.) and has a solid road feel.  Even with the 1.8t and the 5 speed it craves another 30-40 hp. Fuel economy is not great. (EPA is 25 city-30 hwy.) My best mileage is only 24.2 mpg in mostly highway driving.  You might get 30 mpg-if you still drive 55 mph on the freeway! With a lead foot in town you can expect about 21-22 mpg.  The culprit is the gearing; it's ""short"" in order to aid acceleration but the engine turns over a fuel-wasting 3700 rpm at 80 mph!  An overdrive 6th gear would help mpg and noise!  Otherwise it is a fun, solidly built convertible with a tight top.  No troubles at 5K miles.",2005,Marca_C,2005-07-08,2005,7,8,Friday

I was a little concerned about all the negatives reviews from other owners, but my experience with VW have been positive. The car feels very solid and offers a very quiet ride.  The Beetle comes standard w/lots of standard safety features that other convertibles don't even offered. If you are looking for a solid, safe and fun to drive convertible, the Beetle is the one.

It has excellent brakes and safety aids, both passive and active.  Its handling is not particularly responsive, but safe and predictable.  This car is able to cruise at high speeds with less wind noise than than in the past because of the 6-speed gearing.  It turns approximately 3,000 RPM at 78 MPH.

2686,1,"The most trouble prone car of them all.  Stay away I bought this car from a family member with only 16K miles and it was garage kept. It's a 2.0 convertible with automatic.  I can't begin to say how cheaply built this car is and VW should be ashamed of this product.  The structure of this car creaks and moans over smooth roads.  The driver's door handle (plastic) was cracked and this cracked the entire door panel.  Replacements are hard to find and expensive.  I got a new door panel and got metal door handles from ebay.  The driver's door latch switch broke.  This needed an entire latch and the switch lowers the window when opening and closing the door.  Without this switch say goodbye to the top. So I did this myself.  Then the rear plastics all cracked.  Then the flaps to cover the top frame broke and the top wouldn't move so I took them off to fix it. Then the rear window separated from the canvas.  I repaired the rear glass to save me the $2500 for a new top.  Once I had this fixed, then the rear driver's window regulator broke.  I took this to my friend and he fixed it for $300, but then the power top broke.  So I disabled the power top and do it by hand since I'm done fixing stuff on this car.  So it's fate is destined to be the in junkyard, but for now it's just rolling junk waiting for it's destiny.  All of these repairs are on a low mileage, well maintained car. Other driving impressions- it drives like a cheap economy car.  Braking is good.  Acceleration is below average.  Transmission and engine are still working for some reason.  Structure is poor as I described above. Interior storage is average. rear seat room is tight.  Paint is good.  30MPG highway.  I can not recommend this car under any circumstances even if it's given to you for free.  It is very poorly over-engineered.  Parts quality is very poor.   Construction quality is poor with cheap brittle plastic and weak adhesives holding things together. Parts cost is very high and availability is poor as it may need to be shipped from Germany.

A few years ago i made a 5400 mile trip in 84 hours flat, yes do the math on that one! I certainly was tired when i got to my destination and returning home but was no where near as sore as every other vehicle i have ever been owned! Gotta love the VW seats and interior design!

I use light weight synthetic oils in the engine and tranny. I run my tires at their max on the sidewall giving me nearly perfect tread wear across the entire surface of the tires. My best tank was 760 miles on one tank! I spent a lot of time nursing it to the top both times. INCREDIBLE!! My only complaint however, is that VW used flimsy ""Rivets"" to hold the third member together that the ring gear bolts to in the little 5 spd transmission. A couple of the rivets flew out and punched a 3""-4"" hole in the lower side of the transmission housing. At about 156k we removed the tranny to install a new clutch and much to our surprise we found the ""inspection hole"" they caused when they flew out. Costing us an unnecessary case replacement/tranny rebuild! We drilled out the remaining rivets and installed the recommended API bolt kit and all is good!

And burning high cetane, low sulfur fuel or better yet a 20% blend of biodiesel, keeps the emissions low.

This car has left me stranded on SO many occasions. I'm fearful to even drive this death trap. Please save yourself the heart ache, do NOT buy an older model beetle.

I LOVE the turning radius! And ADORE the fact that I can get in and out of tough parking places!

It has belt tensioners, dome roll-cage (convertibles have stability thing I think), six airbags, and anti-intrusion door beams, and more!

2960,5,"Old Faithful At 243K, still going strong.  Needed new transmission at 230K but likely because I overuse the 5th gear at low speed to improve mileage and wore it out.  My only complaint is the interior parts.  Rear seat fell apart in the first week.  Center console fell apart shortly after.  Surprisingly rotten and cheap parts on such a worthy vehicle.  Diesel needs to be treated with anti-gel for 3 months  of Northeast winter and I had a pre-heater installed after the glow-plugs cooked and were too rusted in to replace.  This diesel car had real trouble starting below -10F with glow plugs working and below 20F after they died so a heater really protects battery, starter and engine.  Check engine light has been on for last 100k miles but that’s just something you deal with in the age of science and technology.

Great visibility combined with quick reaction and maneuverability in (Los Angeles) traffic with exceptional fuel mileage and only normal expected wear and tear expenses make this a great value.  Very easy to park.  5 speed manual transmission is very reliable.  33 mpg on open road.  Uses a quart of oil each 1,000 miles based on design, I am told.  Michelin Pilot A/S Sports lasted 51,000 miles.  Replaced timing belt, water pump and plugs at 135,000 miles.  Most parts are reasonably priced.

It holds the road well on Interstate roads at zippy speeds.

3003,4,"My little turd Let me start off by saying that I've owned 2 New beetles, one 1998 and my current is 2002.  4 years and a hundred thousand miles really make a difference.  I've always been a huge fan of the shape, but driving one is a great experience.   What it lacks in power, it makes up for in handling.  The car handles like new, very sturdy, minimal vibrations, smooth over most terrains and has good traction in all weather types (granted, I did put new tires on the car recently).  Though engine noise is audible, it is not very bothersome, especially at higher speeds where the car really shines.  Going 70 mph and over is very smooth in the car.  The interior is made of cheap plastic parts that break often, but replacements are easily found online or you can paint the chipping plastic yourself like I have.  The seats are extremely comfortable in the front seats, the same cannot be said for the backseats, especially if you are over 5'9.  Even though the car has limited room for backseat passengers, the rear seats fold down to create a large amount of cargo space which is very nice.  I've also read a lot reliability issues and reviews about this car and similar years, but I have yet to experience any huge problems *knocks on wood.*  I have kept up on oil changes and regular maintenance and have found this car to have a very reliable engine.  Ive paid for new headlight bulb, new tires, transmission fluid change, brake pads and rotors all around and to have my heater core replace.  Mind you this is over the span of about 2 years and about 20,000 miles.  I've never had a problem with my car and I will continue to drive it, as it is very eye catching and gets great gas mileage.UPDATE 6/17 - I've now had the car for 3 years and 40,000+ miles.  Recently everything started to break so I had to adjust my reliability score.  New throttle body, 4 DIFFERENT mass air flow sensors, ignition coil, spark plugs and wires, control arms, ball joints, struts, shocks, alternator, all 3 engine mounts, serpentine belt and tensioner, catalytic converter and full cat-back exhaust system...and I'm sure I'm missing a few.

It's so easy to clean, and the yellow paint is bright and holds up well. Interior plastics break, there's rattles, it's slow, but who cares it gets me everywhere and barely costs me a dime. I baby it to death, wax it, only run chevron but no premium gas and I don't use synthetic but will now cause I want to just keep it going.I recently sold the Beetle at 167,000 miles for $3,000 and got back every penny I spent on it, bought a Jetta. The beetle is still going strong in the West part of Phx. Buy a manual GL!",2002,Marca_C,2015-12-26,2015,12,26,Saturday

This car sat in the shop 19 of the first 24 months of ownership. I couldn't keep the electronics,transmission, turbo and anything else working. The last 2 years and $2300.00 of maintenance cost finally sealed its fate. 1100 for Timing belt change,450 for door latch which shut the car down in the middle of a 4 lane highway. 600 for alternator and whatever else it needed.

My daughter was stranded 6 times over 11 months. Thank GOD i purchased an extended warranty (1yr/12,000miles) for $1,100 (the premium warranty) - which covered (ready for this) $4,652.27 in repairs.

Shoddy plastic parts often broke down, such as the hatch release and center console. The sunroof is also a water hazard, but I hear VW has issued a recall on that.

Then it was the multiple windows breaking in the car that would go down but then not come up (driver, passenger side, and driver's back window).

It was a horrifying experience because i felt no security in the car whatsoever when getting into the accident, there's so little to the car if i hit any harder the entire front of my car would've been gone probably.

I should have listened, because this piece of junk has been in the shop 4 times to fix various squeaks and rattles and we haven't even had the first oil change yet.  So far gas mileage has been in the 22-24 mpg range, mostly suburban driving.  While it's within the EPA estimates, it's still low for a car this small.  Did I mention that it requires synthetic oil and a filter not carried at any quick lube establishments?    ",2008,Marca_C,2008-08-03,2008,8,3,Sunday
3096,5,Fun Car Nice fun car - gas mileage could be somewhat better.  The triple white model is really fun.  I like the solid feel of the way it drives - tight.

The appearance and features are all basically the same as all my other New Beetles, however, the gas mileage is another story.  I have paid more for gas than I have in payments for this car since I purchased it.  It is only averaging 200 miles per tank of gas.  I have had it to the dealership for service, and they insist that there is no problem with it.  My last full tank of gas I got 193 miles.

Volkswagen vehicle of ANY kind for me! They used to make Beetles to where they lasted for decades, but not really anymore. I know that vehicles are machines; therefore, they are going to have some issues, but come on!! One thing after another!! When one thing breaks- here breaks something else. The air bag light came on allegedly having to do with a code, but then I needed a newer battery that I had just bought not even quite 4 years prior! I was told that little things like the air bag will come on so it will bother you to take it do the dealership to get it repaired- they will find something the matter.  After so many miles that you drive, little things like the light to something will appear among other things, too. I have also learned that when you buy a vehicle, make sure that you will be able to afford the parts- VW parts are WAAAAAAY to expensive! The car is expensive enough! When I see people driving down the road with a new Beetle, I think to myself that they have no idea what they have just gotten themselves into. The interior can be of better quality and material given fact that the car is very expensive. I have also learned that if you buy a Beetle convertible, keep in mind that the convertible top may be of very poor and of cheap quality; you will most likely need to replace the convertible top eventually and they are NOT cheap.

My 2006 VW NEW BEETLE 6 speed A/T came with everything available, clear down to convertible top boot, wind screen, leather everything, seat warmers, satellite radio.

Turbos were standard in this model and this little car kicks gas, so fun to drive. Having said that, it's a Bug, low tech as they come but efficient and with usual German sensibility everything is where it should be in the cockpit.

To replace a simple part, VW interior parts come with the whole entire assembly... I guess they hope that they will get all of your money.

Don't even think about it...many mechanics either won't want to touch your beetle or they will not be able to fix it since it's an electrical nightmare that's built like a puzzle! And how is it that a chord has broken on the top? That happened at about 40,000 miles.

I read online this frequently happens. My driver's side window regulator went out and that cost me $470.00 to fix..now I have to take to replace the convertible top because the back window is separating from the top and water can get in.

The front seating is fairly comfortable - the seat moves 7 directions so you can sit up, like in a chair, or down more as if in a sporty car.

For the past 4 years, I had 20 visits to the dealership including oil change, recall, warranties so I am always there every 3 months. I had an oil change done on the 50k mileage and took it back to the dealer when i found oil leaks.  They changed the drain plug but after 2 days I need to bring it back to the dealer for more oil leak.  Brought it in the morning, then they can't find the source of the oil leak I was told to leave it overnight.  Spent so much money for regular maintenance all done through dealers. So unfair, VW.

I had the oil changed when I returned + tire rotation, cost -  18.79. I was told to have the oil changed every 5000 miles. All in all, it's a great little car!

The 5 cylinder gasoline motor provides a great amount of performance- you may find yourself exceeding your local speed limits.  Having grown up with other earlier VW models, the 2006 is the tightest in respect to fit and finish.  I consider my New Beetle ""my poor man's Porsche"".

I thought that it would be very whimpy after only driving 6- & 8-cylinder vehicles, but I was wrong! It's a true sports car! The tiptronic transmission is awesome too, you can feel the car shifting, which is a trip if you are not used to driving stick shift. It's a true stick feel, but with all the ease of an automatic.

The engine cover falls off once or twice a year, which I hear happens a lot to new beetles.  A cute car, but ridiculous to maintain.  I didn't start having problems until it was about 4 years old.  When I bought it, I sure expected it to last me more than 75,000 miles.  ",2000,Marca_C,2008-06-04,2008,6,4,Wednesday
3295,4,"Greatest Car in the Whole Darn Universe! I bought my Beetle Baby used!!  I loved it from day 1 that I first saw it.  The color is bright green with a sunroof.  After I had it for about 3 months I had problems getting it started, but that was due to the mechanic not knowing what he was doing.  My next car is going to be a convertible Beetle Baby.",2000,Marca_C,2008-05-11,2008,5,11,Sunday
3296,3,"Pain in the back I have had more trouble with this car than I care to admit.  I got more frustrated because I like the way the car drives but I have had to replace so many parts in this car from an oxygen sensor 3 times to the turbo engine at 40,000.  That is ridiculous! The dealerships want to rake the consumer over the coals in price of repair!",2000,Marca_C,2008-04-12,2008,4,12,Saturday
3297,2,"Too Bad This was a fun car. But its low level of quality really stinks. Something was always broken. The bulbs for the headlight are impossible to change if the plastic mounting/locking device for the headlight assembly break (the dealer confirmed that was the case). 10,000 miles before the timing belt was due to be changed the tensioner broke destroying the engine. And because VW makes the engine mounting holes different for different models with the same engine you can not interchange them. This became a pricey repair ($7,000 before it was done). The airbag and a sensor both went bad. Several sensors went bad. It was a nightmare. I was very happy to get rid of it.",2000,Marca_C,2008-03-13,2008,3,13,Thursday
3298,4,"Good value, cool snug bug, but..  Nimble handling, chic style and VW's engineering has not let us down in the 2 years we've driven it. Warning! Replacement of body panels may be extremely delayed. We had to wait two months for a new rear right panel - from Japan - to replace our dented end. It kept our New Beetle in the shop all that time.",2000,Marca_C,2007-07-09,2007,7,9,Monday
3299,2,"BAD CAR! Do not buy a VW. I cannot wait to get rid of this lemon. I bought this brand new back in 2000 and have had nothing but problems. Although they are not too major, they are annoying and cause a lot of anxiety. About once or twice a year my car decides not to start AT ALL and leaves me stranded. It will be running like a beauty one day and completely dead the next. Electrical problems galore, peeling door handles, plastic parts break, etc., etc., etc. Fortunately my father is a mechanic otherwise I would be seriously in debt up to my eyeballs. I actually feel guilty trading this lemon in!! I am getting a Honda or Toyota next time. This thing has been recalled more times than I can count!",2000,Marca_C,2007-07-02,2007,7,2,Monday
